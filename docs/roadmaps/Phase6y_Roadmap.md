# Phase 6y: SU(d > 2) Substrate Extension + Full Multi-Qubit Solovay-Kitaev (Academic Completeness)

## Technical Roadmap — May 2026

*Prepared 2026-05-26 PM, following the Phase 6x lift/shift retrospective audit.*

**Trigger condition:** Phase 6x completes at the *lift/shift* interpretation level (per the updated Phase 6x Roadmap and the Phase 6x retrospective): T-A1 ships as "1Q-rotations-compiled-via-Phase-6u-Clifford+T + MS-as-primitive"; T-A2 ships at the CCZ-alphabet-substrate level only; the SU(d > 2) extension and the full multi-qubit Solovay-Kitaev compilation are *explicitly deferred* to Phase 6y. Phase 6y picks up the substantive SU(d) substrate work that the Phase 6x lift/shift framing deferred.

**Headline goal:** Generalize the Phase 6u SU(2)-targeted quantitative Solovay-Kitaev substrate to arbitrary `d ≥ 2`, enabling **kernel-verified compilation of arbitrary unitaries in SU(d)** for d-dimensional gate sets. Validate at three instances: (1) trapped-ion native gates at SU(4) (Mølmer-Sørensen + 1Q with the full 2-qubit Hilbert-space target); (2) Clifford+CCZ at SU(8) (3-qubit full compilation, not just CCZ-as-primitive); (3) generic SU(d) instance for documentation purposes. Ship Mathlib-PR-quality SU(d) Cartan substrate as community-citizenship deliverable.

**Predecessor work assumed clean:**
- Phase 6x lift/shift closure (T-A1 1Q-compiled-with-MS-primitive + T-A2 CCZ-substrate-only) — ships first.
- Phase 6u generic SU(2)-targeted substrate (Waves 1-6 + Wave 4b) — the SU(2) baseline being generalized.
- M.1 (`SKEFTHawking.MatrixBCHCubic.bch_order_2_cubic_thm`) — the underlying lemma is already generic over `{d : ℕ}` matrix dimension (`Matrix (Fin d) (Fin d) ℂ`). Phase 6x completion ships the `Matrix m m ℂ` reindex generalization + de-privatization at `Matrix.BCH.bchOrder2Cubic`. Phase 6y Track S can begin against the `(Fin d)`-indexed lemma since the `m : Type*` generalization is mechanical reindexing; Phase 6y consumers should use whichever form (Fin-indexed or m-indexed) is available when Track S sub-waves ship.

**Project rule applied:** No new project-local axioms (Pipeline Invariant #15 RESPECTED). No `maxHeartbeats` overrides in proof bodies (Invariant #10). The SU(d) extension work is multi-session and *substrate-heavy*; each track scopes the Mathlib-upstream option from Stage 1.

---

> **AGENT INSTRUCTIONS — READ BEFORE ANY PHASE 6y WAVE WORK:**
>
> 1. **Mandatory project bootstrap** per workspace `CLAUDE.md` Mandatory References list.
> 2. **Read this roadmap + the Phase 6x retrospective** (`docs/stakeholder/Phase6x_Implications.md`, `docs/stakeholder/Phase6x_Strategic_Positioning.md`) to understand WHY Phase 6y exists as a separate phase rather than as Phase 6x completion. The TLDR: Phase 6x's lift/shift framing yielded substantial substrate work to Phase 6y; this roadmap picks up that work.
> 3. **Read `Phase6u_Roadmap.md` end-to-end** — Phase 6y generalizes the Phase 6u SU(2)-targeted Generic substrate to SU(d). Familiarity with `GenericSU2GeneratingSet`, `GenericClosureDenseWitness`, `GenericSolovayKitaevRecursion`, `dnStepFG_su2`, `CartanFinalStep_SU2_v4` is mandatory.
> 4. **Critical substrate — read source directly:**
>    - **`SKEFTHawking.MatrixBCHCubic.bch_order_2_cubic_thm`** — already generic over `{d : ℕ}` matrix dimension; the load-bearing analytic substrate for SU(d) Cartan extension.
>    - **`SKEFTHawking.FKLW.CartanSubstrate.CartanFinalStep_SU2_v4`** (SU(2) version) and the discharge in `SU2BCHBracketClosure.lean::CartanFinalStep_SU2_v4_holds` — the SU(2) template the SU(d) ship generalizes.
>    - **`SKEFTHawking.FKLW.OneParameterSubgroupSU2.SU2_nhd_one_covered_by_exp_ts`** — the SU(2) local diffeomorphism that needs SU(d) generalization via IFT.
>    - **Mathlib's `NormedSpace.exp`, `HasStrictFDerivAt.exp`, `IsCompact.elim_finite_subcover`** — the upstream substrate the SU(d) ship composes on.
> 5. **Do not delegate substantive theorem proving to subagents** for the load-bearing SU(d) substrate extension sub-waves. MCP loop default; Aristotle is fallback. Background agents OK for Mathlib-API search + composition work.
> 6. **No PM / time estimates anywhere** — by user direction.
> 7. **Pivot rule re-clarified per the Phase 6x retrospective:** Invariant #15's "no project-local axioms" rule applies ONLY when an axiom is genuinely required (substrate missing from Mathlib4 AND no constructive path exists). It does NOT apply when work is substantial-but-doable. The Phase 6x retrospective explicitly catalogued this conflation as a failure mode; Phase 6y consumers should ship substantively across multiple sessions rather than yielding on "substantial work" grounds.

## Track catalog

Four primary tracks, organized by substrate dependency (highest-substrate-first; each later track consumes the prior):

  - **Track S** (SU(d > 2) substrate extension, lift Phase 6u to arbitrary dimension): **highest priority + load-bearing**. All downstream tracks depend on this.
  - **Track M-S** (Mathlib upstream of SU(d) substrate): runs in parallel with Track S; community-citizenship for the substrate.
  - **Track T-A1′** (full SU(4) trapped-ion compilation; "academic completeness" T-A1): consumes Track S, generalizes from the Phase 6x lift/shift T-A1.
  - **Track T-A2′** (full SU(8) Clifford+CCZ compilation; "academic completeness" T-A2): consumes Track S, generalizes from the Phase 6x T-A2 CCZ-matrix substrate.

**Status legend** (matches prior phases):
- ✅ **SHIPPED** — Lean / numerical deliverables committed and kernel-verified.
- 🟡 **IN-PROGRESS** — partial deliverables shipped.
- 📝 **WORKING DOC** — Stage-1 substrate-analysis or audit draft only.
- ⏳ **NOT STARTED**.

| Track | Codename | Status | Bundle absorption |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Track S** | SU(d > 2) substrate extension (the Phase 6u Generic substrate generalized to arbitrary d). The largest single deliverable: generalize `GenericSU2GeneratingSet` (carrier ρ_hom into SU(2) → ρ_hom into SU(d)), `CartanFinalStep_SU2_v4` → `CartanFinalStep_SUd_v4`, `dnStepFG_su2` → `dnStepFG_sud`, `Y_h` Lipschitz d-dependent. | ⏳ NOT STARTED | I1 substrate + D4 §9.8 multi-alphabet showcase extension |
| **Track M-S** | Mathlib upstream contributions extracting the SU(d) substrate from the project's Phase 6y ship to Mathlib4-PR-quality. Two anchors: (M-S.1) Generic Cartan v4 density-from-witness at SU(d); (M-S.2) `NormedSpace.exp` strict-F-derivative at zero for Lie subalgebras + the local diffeomorphism corollary. | ⏳ NOT STARTED | (Mathlib4 upstream; no project-bundle absorption) |
| **Track T-A1′** | Full SU(4) trapped-ion compilation (academic completeness): compile arbitrary `U ∈ SU(4)` via the Phase 6y SU(d) extension; MS(θ) + 1Q rotations no longer treated as primitives but compiled into the discrete alphabet. Consumes Track S; supersedes the Phase 6x T-A1 lift/shift ship as the "full" T-A1. | ⏳ NOT STARTED | D4 §9.8 multi-alphabet showcase + E1 cross-bridge |
| **Track T-A2′** | Full SU(8) Clifford+CCZ compilation (academic completeness): compile arbitrary `U ∈ SU(8)` via the Phase 6y SU(d) extension; CCZ no longer treated as primitive but compiled. Consumes Track S; supersedes the Phase 6x T-A2 CCZ-matrix-substrate ship. | ⏳ NOT STARTED | D4 §9.8 + fault-tolerant-architecture cross-bridge |

**Track dependencies:**
- Track S is the keystone; all others consume it.
- Track M-S can begin in parallel with Track S (extracting Mathlib-PR-quality presentations as Track S sub-waves ship).
- Track T-A1′ and Track T-A2′ are independent once Track S ships; can run in parallel.

## Track S detail — SU(d > 2) substrate extension

### Goal

Generalize the Phase 6u alphabet-agnostic quantitative Solovay-Kitaev substrate from SU(2)-targeted to SU(d)-targeted for arbitrary `d ≥ 2`. The shipped substrate enables **kernel-verified compilation of arbitrary unitaries in SU(d)** at any `d`, with error and length bounds at the same algorithmic compile level — the same shape as the Phase 6u SU(2) headline but at arbitrary dimension.

### Sub-wave decomposition

**S.1 — `GenericSUdGeneratingSet`** (~100-200 LoC). Generalize the `GeneratingSet` structure: replace `ρ_hom : W →* specialUnitaryGroup (Fin 2) ℂ` with `ρ_hom : W →* specialUnitaryGroup (Fin d) ℂ` for arbitrary d (parametrized at the structure level or via subtype). All downstream lemmas thread d through.

**S.2 — `CartanFinalStep_SUd_v4`** (~400-700 LoC; the biggest single piece). Generalize Phase 6p's `CartanFinalStep_SU2_v4` to SU(d). Conceptually:
  - Two ℝ-LI tangent flow lines in `𝔰𝔲(d)` (dimension `d² − 1`) ⟹ closed subgroup = ⊤.
  - For d = 2 (3-dim algebra), 2 LI tangents + 1 bracket = 3 = dim 𝔰𝔲(2). For d ≥ 3, the spanning argument requires more tangents OR a Lie-closure argument (the iterated brackets of 2 generic LI tangents span 𝔰𝔲(d) for any compact simple Lie group).
  - The local diffeomorphism `𝔰𝔲(d) → SU(d)` near identity via IFT on `expMap`. Mathlib4 v4.29.1 has the IFT (`HasStrictFDerivAt.toOpenPartialHomeomorph`) and the matrix `NormedSpace.exp` derivative at zero (`HasStrictFDerivAt.exp_zero`); composition gives the local diffeomorphism.
  - The open-subgroup-containing-identity-interior → ⊤ argument generalizes directly.

**S.3 — `dnStepFG_sud`** (~200-400 LoC). Generalize Phase 6t's Dawson-Nielsen balanced-commutator decomposition from SU(2) to SU(d). The SU(2) version uses Bloch-sphere parametrization; the SU(d) version uses the general `𝔰𝔲(d)` balanced-commutator existence theorem (which IS in the Aharonov-Arad lineage and SHOULD be generalizable).

**S.4 — `Y_h` Lipschitz d-dependent** (~150-300 LoC). The matrix-log Lipschitz constant in Phase 6u is π/2 (SU(2)-Bloch-specific). For SU(d), the constant depends on d via the operator-norm bound of the matrix exponential's inverse near the identity. Generalize.

**S.5 — Generic SU(d) discharge** (~300-500 LoC). The Phase 6u Wave 4b 800-LoC discharge generalized to SU(d) — uses S.1-S.4 above plus the existing `bch_order_2_cubic_thm` (already generic over d).

**S.6 — `solovayKitaev_dawson_nielsen_quantitative_generic_sud_strict_constructive_tight`** (~50-100 LoC). Wave 6's bundled-strict generic headline at SU(d).

### Aggregate Track S effort

~1,200-2,200 LoC across 5-8 sessions. The biggest single piece is S.2 (Cartan v4 at SU(d)); the others are mechanical generalizations.

### Audience

Mathlib4 working groups (Lie theory, matrix exponentials), formal-methods quantum-computing researchers (the SU(d) substrate is a one-time investment that unlocks all higher-dimensional gate-set Solovay-Kitaev ships).

### Risk

MEDIUM. The conceptual content is established (Phase 6u SU(2) version + the SU(d) generalization is standard Lie theory). The risk is in the LoE — the multi-session investment is real. No axioms required; no exotic substrate; just substantial composition.

---

## Track M-S detail — Mathlib upstream of SU(d) substrate

### Goal

Extract the Phase 6y Track S substrate as Mathlib-PR-quality contributions, generalizing the M.2 SU(2) presentation (Phase 6x) to the full SU(d) substrate.

### Sub-wave decomposition

**M-S.1 — Mathlib `Matrix.SpecialUnitary.Cartan.finalStepVd`** (~200-400 LoC). The SU(d) Cartan v4 density-from-witness as a Mathlib-conventional namespace entry. Builds on M.2 (which documented the SU(d) extension plan but shipped only SU(2)).

**M-S.2 — Mathlib `Matrix.expMap_isLocalHomeomorph_zero`** (~150-300 LoC). The general local diffeomorphism property of the matrix exponential at zero (the load-bearing substrate for both the SU(d) Cartan classification and the Phase 6u SU(2) ship). Mathlib4 v4.29.1 has the pieces (IFT + matrix exp derivative); the assembled local-homeomorphism statement is missing.

### Aggregate Track M-S effort

~350-700 LoC. Submission-step work + Mathlib reviewer iteration.

### Audience

Mathlib4 community (Lie theory, matrix exponentials, topological groups).

### Risk

LOW. Both M-S.1 and M-S.2 are well-understood mathematically. Submission-step costs are standard.

---

## Track T-A1′ detail — Full SU(4) trapped-ion compilation

### Goal

Generalize the Phase 6x T-A1 lift/shift ship (1Q-compiled + MS-primitive) to the **full SU(4) compilation**: arbitrary `U ∈ SU(4)` compiled via the Phase 6y SU(d) substrate at d = 4. MS(θ) and 1Q rotations are both in the discrete alphabet; the compiler decomposes any 2-qubit unitary.

### Sub-wave decomposition

**T-A1′.1 — `trappedIonGeneratingSetSU4`** (~100-200 LoC). The SU(4)-targeted `GeneratingSet` instance consuming Track S's `GenericSUdGeneratingSet` at d = 4. Generators: MS(θ) at rational-π/N grid + 1Q rotations on each ion at rational-π/N grid.

**T-A1′.2 — Closure-density witness at SU(4)** (~300-500 LoC). The MS(θ) + 1Q rotations alphabet generates a dense subset of SU(4); discharge via the Phase 6y SU(d) Cartan v4 substrate. (The mathematical content is well-known; the formalization is straightforward composition of Track S substrate.)

**T-A1′.{3,4,5} — ε₀-net + calibration + bundled-strict headline** (~200-400 LoC). Standard alphabet instantiation per Phase 6u T-S template, now at SU(4).

### Aggregate Track T-A1′ effort

~600-1,100 LoC across 2-4 sessions (assuming Track S substrate ships first).

### Audience

Industry quantum-compiler teams (Quantinuum, IonQ, AQT), trapped-ion-architecture-research community.

### Risk

LOW after Track S ships. The conceptual content is standard.

---

## Track T-A2′ detail — Full SU(8) Clifford+CCZ compilation

### Goal

Generalize the Phase 6x T-A2 CCZ-matrix-substrate ship to the **full SU(8) compilation**: arbitrary `U ∈ SU(8)` compiled via the Phase 6y SU(d) substrate at d = 8. CCZ is in the discrete alphabet (not primitive); the compiler decomposes any 3-qubit unitary using Clifford + CCZ generators.

### Sub-wave decomposition

**T-A2′.1 — `cliffordCCZGeneratingSetSU8`** (~100-200 LoC). The SU(8)-targeted `GeneratingSet` instance. Generators: per-qubit Hadamard (3 generators), CCZ (1 generator). The discrete alphabet has 4 generators; the closure is dense in SU(8).

**T-A2′.2 — Closure-density witness at SU(8)** (~400-700 LoC). Substantive — the Clifford+CCZ alphabet is known universal for SU(2^n) for any n, but the per-n density witness is non-trivial.

**T-A2′.{3,4,5} — ε₀-net + calibration + bundled-strict headline** (~200-400 LoC).

### Aggregate Track T-A2′ effort

~700-1,300 LoC across 3-5 sessions.

### Audience

Fault-tolerant-architecture researchers (Litinski, O'Gorman, Babbush, Beverland), magic-state-distillation researchers.

### Risk

MEDIUM. The closure-density witness at SU(8) for the Clifford+CCZ alphabet is the trickiest piece; literature on this (Aaronson-Gottesman 2004 and follow-ons) is well-developed but the Lean formalization is new.

---

## Cross-cutting work

### Adversarial-review checkpoints

Per `BUNDLE_LIFT_PROCEDURE.md` Stage 13 hard gate, each Phase 6y track gets its own checkpoint:

  - **CP-S** — after Track S (SU(d) substrate extension).
  - **CP-M-S** — after Track M-S Mathlib upstream PRs file / in-project PR-quality ships.
  - **CP-T-A1′** — after Track T-A1′ ships.
  - **CP-T-A2′** — after Track T-A2′ ships.

### Pipeline Invariants

- **#10 (no `maxHeartbeats`)**: RESPECTED. Phase 6u W4b pattern applies — top-level numerical helpers, not heartbeat-budget overrides.
- **#15 (no new axioms)**: RESPECTED. Phase 6y's substantive content does NOT require axioms; the SU(d) extension composes from Mathlib4 v4.29.1 primitives. The Phase 6x retrospective explicitly cautioned against conflating "substantial work" with "needs axiom"; Phase 6y consumers ship substantively across multiple sessions rather than yielding on "substantial work" grounds.

### M.4 length-conjunct inheritance (Phase 6x → Phase 6y)

The Phase 6x completion ship adds the concrete-word length-bound conjunct
`(compile U ε).toWord.length ≤ <polylog bound>` to all bundled-strict
headlines (CT, RR5, RR7, T-A1 lift/shift). **All Phase 6y bundled-strict
headlines (Track S.6 generic SU(d), Track T-A1′.5 full SU(4), Track
T-A2′.5 full SU(8)) inherit this conjunct shape** — i.e., each per-track
T-X.5 headline statement includes both the error bound `‖compile U ε - U‖ ≤ ε`
AND the concrete-word length conjunct. This is the explicit guardrail
against anti-pattern #4 (substrate-only-shipped vs headline-integrated)
identified in the Phase 6x retrospective.

## Wave 1 — Multi-session execution tracker (started 2026-05-27)

Per [[feedback-multi-session-wave-pattern]] (`memory/feedback_multi_session_wave_pattern.md`): Phase 6y is genuinely multi-session work. Wave 1 is the keystone Track S substrate + downstream T-X′ instantiations. Sessions ship per-AC-item substantively, with each session producing build-clean Lean modules + per-session memory.

### Wave 1 Status block

Phase 6y Wave 1: **IN PROGRESS** (Sessions 1-51 of N shipped 2026-05-27; **38 commits, ~4925 LoC kernel-only**; build clean 8830 jobs throughout).

> **2026-05-28 close update.** All three Phase 6y instances now ship UNCONDITIONAL + kernel-only:
> Track S SU(d) substrate (cascade unconditional, regime existential eliminated), **T-A1′ SU(4)**,
> and **T-A2′ SU(8)** (the (D) witness `cliffordCCZSU8_solovayKitaev_headline_unconditional`,
> commit `3e3d2f4`). A **whole-phase fresh-context adversarial sweep** (6u/6x/6y, 4 parallel reviewers)
> returned **GREEN / GREEN-WITH-RECOMMENDED with ZERO BLOCKER and ZERO REQUIRED**; all RECOMMENDED
> doc/citation items remediated (`bb1dacb`/`cf786d8`/`ec12f58`).
> **Honest scope:** T-A2′ ships *Clifford+T at SU(8)* (universal Clifford+CCZ+T alphabet; density from
> the `{H,T,CNOT}` sub-alphabet, CCZ over-complete/unused). The faithful *CCZ-essential* literal
> headline is a tracked strengthening: **Phase A.1 shipped** (`70e17b9`, `CliffordCCZSU8LiteralSeed`:
> seed `g=CCZ·(H⊗H⊗H)`, `tr(g)=1/√2`); Phase B (irrationality) + Phase C (Kronecker–Weyl
> closure→1-param-subgroup lift, needs a proof-sketch sub-spike) pending. DR seed spike in
> `Lit-Search/Phase-6y/`.
> **Track-S labeling nuance (sweep RECOMMENDED):** the *generic* SU(d) headline is unconditional
> *modulo the (D) `IsDenseInSUd_gs` witness*; the *per-alphabet* SU(4)/SU(8) headlines are FULLY
> unconditional (witnesses discharged).
> **Remaining follow-ons (non-close-blockers):** M-S substantive Mathlib-PR extraction (PR files
> currently alias-only); D4 §9.8 bundle absorption (held for a separate user-authorized event);
> exact counts/Inventory refresh — **blocked by `ExtractDeps.lean` extraction exceeding its 1800s
> timeout** (per-declaration axiom-closure walk over the grown Phase-6y substrate; needs a perf fix —
> likely memoizing `collectAxioms` — or a longer offline run).

- **AC items NOT YET shipped**: S.6/T-X′.5 polylog UNCONDITIONAL bundled-strict headlines (cascade-ready via Session 50's `skHeadline_FreeGroup_SUd_cascade_2ingredient`; require remaining 2 ingredient discharges + per-alphabet baseFinder), T-X′.2 substantive density witnesses (Brylinski-Brylinski SU(4) + Aaronson-Gottesman SU(8) — multi-session each), M-S substantive Mathlib-PR extraction, Stage-13 fresh-context adversarial review.

### Sessions 14-51 inventory (per-session map)

  - **Sessions 14-39** (Track S.3 keystone substrate chain): 27 modules in `lean/SKEFTHawking/FKLW/GenericSUd*.lean` building up to the keystone `symmetric_balanced_commutator_hermitian_unconditional` (Session 33) + predicate-form lifts + norm bridge + bounded form + index + usage examples + loose predicate.

  2. **Length-bound recursion discharge** — proves `wordLength (skApproxC_generic_sud ... n U) ≤ skLength_sud baseCase decompCost n` (relating actual recursion word length to Session 51's closed-form).
  3. **`SkLengthPolylogBound_sud` substantive discharge** — asymptotic analysis of `skLength_sud (skLevel_polylog_sud K ε) ≤ c · (log(1/ε))^polylogExponent` (similar to SU(2) `skLength_at_skLevel_polylog_le` proof).
  4. **Per-alphabet baseFinder + ε-net** at SU(4)/SU(8) for T-A1′.5 / T-A2′.5 headlines.
  5. **T-X′.2 substantive density witnesses**: Brylinski-Brylinski 2002 (SU(4) trapped-ion entangler universality) + Aaronson-Gottesman 2004 (Clifford+CCZ at SU(8)). Multi-session each.
  6. **M-S.1/M-S.2 substantive Mathlib-PR extraction** (de-privatize + Mathlib-namespace + generic-type + docstrings + examples; per F#3 alias-only NOT acceptance).
  7. **Stage-13 fresh-context adversarial review pass** — CLOSURE gate; dispatched ONLY after ALL items above ship.

### Wave 1 Plan (per-session)

**Sessions 48-51 (SHIPPED 2026-05-27 — Track S.6 substantive ingredient discharges, 2 of 4)**:
- **Session 48** (`09a939a`): **SUBSTANTIVE polylog level spec discharge** — `skLevel_polylog_sud_spec_holds` given calibration `K² · 2·ε₀_sud ≤ 1/4`.
- **Session 49** (`64c7e64`): **SUBSTANTIVE det predicate discharge** — `expIsud_det_eq_one_predicate_holds` via spectral decomposition + Matrix.exp_conj + Matrix.exp_diagonal + Matrix.det_diagonal + Pi.exp_def + Complex.exp_sum.
- **Session 50** (`4c3c4b7`): refined 2-ingredient cascade leveraging Sessions 48 + 49.
- **Session 51** (`a0594ef`): `skLength_sud` closed-form word-length substrate.

**Sessions 52-54 (SHIPPED 2026-05-27 — additional Track S.6 + per-alphabet substrate)**:
- **Session 52** (`27bd7f7`): UNCONDITIONAL `expIsud` at SU(d≥2) composing Sessions 42 + 49 (removes det-hypothesis).
- **Session 53** (`68934bc`): **SUBSTANTIVE length-bound recursion discharge** at SU(d), parametric wordLength. Lifts Phase 6x SU(2) proof mechanically.
- **Session 54** (`9389f38`): per-alphabet length-bound specializations at SU(4) trapped-ion + SU(8) Clifford+CCZ via `FreeGroup.norm_mul_le` + `FreeGroup.norm_inv_eq`.

**Sessions 55+ (PENDING) — remaining substantive ingredients**:
- Super-quad bound discharge (`SkApproxCSuperQuadraticBound_generic_sud`) — analog of SU(2) ~1236 LoC structure per Explore-agent intel; mechanically liftable (alphabet-agnostic via MonoidHom abstractions). Multi-session.
- Polylog asymptotic for length bound (`SkLengthPolylogBound_sud` discharge) — exponent mismatch with headline form's `log 5 / log 2`; needs sharper recursion analysis OR exponent revision.
- Per-alphabet length-bounded baseFinder construction at SU(4)/SU(8) — uses constructive ε-net substrate already shipped (`GenericSUdConstructiveEpsilonNet.lean`).
- T-X′.2 substantive density witnesses: Brylinski-Brylinski 2002 (SU(4)) + Aaronson-Gottesman 2004 (SU(8)). Each multi-session.
- Stage-13 fresh-context adversarial review (CLOSURE gate) — dispatched ONLY after all substantive items ship.

**Updated cumulative tally (Sessions 14-59)**: **46 commits + 2 docs syncs, ~6000 LoC kernel-only**. Build clean 8838 jobs.

**Sessions 70-82 (SHIPPED 2026-05-27 — F/G-norm bound chain for the (B) ingredient)**:
The F-norm bound `‖F‖ ≤ K_F·√(θ/2)` (the hardest sub-piece of the (B) super-quad
bound) is now FULLY discharged at the dnStep level via an explicit assembly chain:
- **Session 69** (`0ba7310`): bounded-form (F,G) at dnStep level (`‖F‖ ≤ (n+2)²·‖F_inner‖`).
- **Session 70** (`bc3fb0c`): σ_y/σ_x-block sum linftyOp norm bound (`‖∑γσ_y‖ ≤ ∑|γ|`).
- **Session 71** (`1777fb5`): permutation-conjugation linftyOp norm preservation.
- **Session 72** (`9253a01`): γ-sum algebraic decomposition (`∑√(θ·b/2) ≤ √(θ/2)·card·√B`).
- **Session 73** (`7207cad`): Hermitian eigenvalue ≤ linftyOp norm (Gershgorin).
- **Session 74** (`35dc0cc`): partial-sum arithmetic bound.
- **Sessions 75-78** (`babff73`/`a8a3c31`/`44166ec`/`23c51c2`): composed F_inner norm bound,
  γ-sum-of-abs capstone, bounded symmetric diagonal discharge, permMatrixAsUnitary conj bridge.
- **Session 79** (`a93ba94`): bounded FULL diagonal discharge `symmetric_balanced_commutator_diagonal_real_full_bounded` (threads S77+S78 through eigenvalue-sort conjugation).
- **Session 80** (`ef0e88e`): explicit-∑√ bounded Hermitian discharge `symmetric_balanced_commutator_hermitian_via_spectral_bounded_explicit` (re-threads S37 with S79 → `‖F‖ ≤ (n+2)²·∑√(θ·b'_p/2)`).
- **Session 81** (`b468965`): CONCRETE `K_F·√(θ/2)` bounded keystone `symmetric_balanced_commutator_hermitian_unconditional_bounded` (composes S80 + Gershgorin + γ-sum → `‖F‖ ≤ (n+2)²·(n+1)·√(n+2)·√(θ/2)` for ‖H‖≤1).
- **Session 82** (`60eb1fa`): RE-WIRED `dnStepFG_sud` to extract (F,G) from the bounded keystone (S81) + DISCHARGED `DnStepFG_sud_F/G_norm_bound_predicate` at `K_F = (n+2)²·(n+1)·√(n+2)`. Field projections preserved → all 8 downstream consumers unaffected (full build clean 8849 jobs).

**Session 83 (SHIPPED 2026-05-27 — `7f1bba8`)**: dnStepFG_sud structural extraction lemmas (`GenericSUdDnStepFGCommutator.lean`): `dnStepFG_sud_commutator_identity_valid` (`[F,G] = -matrixLog (n+2) Δ.val` in the valid branch) + `dnStepFG_sud_invalid_F_G_zero` (F=G=0 outside the regime). Refactored dnStepFG_sud's norm proof into named lemma `normalize_smul_norm_le_one`. Full build clean 8850 jobs.

**Sessions 84-87 (SHIPPED 2026-05-27 — `3d6f854`/`b10ceaf`/`65df43a`/`fcea8f6`)**: ALL super-quad per-step ingredients + MonoidHom abstractions: S84 `dnStepFG_sud_exp_neg_comm_eq_Delta` (exp(-[F,G])=Δ); S85 `expIsud_norm_sub_one_le` + inverse (≤ δ·exp δ, exact inverse via expIsud_inv_val_eq_exp_neg); S86 `dnStepFG_sud_gC_minus_Delta_norm_le_cubic` (≤320·δ³); S87 `ρ_hom_sud_mul/inv/groupCommutator_val` MonoidHom abstractions. `groupCommutator_stability_nearIdentity` already dimension-generic.

**Sessions 88-89 (SHIPPED 2026-05-27 — `3e8b5bb`/`ae1ebb9`)**: S88 CALIBRATION UNBLOCK — `K_compose_sud` bumped `1024·d^4 → 1024·d^16` (per-step K_proof ≈ 320·d^13 from cubic+telescoping; all K-parametric dependents rebuild unchanged, confirming the calibration architecture). S89 super-quad main-induction BASE CASE `skApproxC_generic_sud_zero_error_bound` (level-0 ≤ 2·ε₀) in new `GenericSUdSuperQuadInduction.lean`.

**Updated cumulative tally (Sessions 14-103)**: **~90 commits, ~9300 LoC kernel-only**. Build clean 8345 jobs. 🎯 S102 (B) DISCHARGED + S103 fed (B) into S.6 cascade → headline now conditional on (D)+regime+length only. Remaining: (D-SU4)/(D-SU8) density witnesses + regime/length discharge + UNCONDITIONAL headlines + M-S extraction + Stage-13. 🎯 S102 = (B) SUPER-QUAD BOUND DISCHARGED (SkApproxCSuperQuadraticBound_generic_sud_holds). The hardest (B) ingredient DONE; remaining: feed (B) into S.6 cascade + (D-SU4)/(D-SU8) density witnesses + M-S extraction + Stage-13. 🎯 S101 SINGLE-STEP VALID-BRANCH BOUND (skApproxC_sud_succ_super_quad_valid) integrates ALL (B) substrate. ONLY the Nat.rec wrap (with per-level regime establishment) remains for (B). S96 stability-through-Vn + S97-S99 numeric chain (THE arithmetic core: 334d^16 ≤ 1024d^16) + S100 F/G-norm-in-√ε. Remaining (B): final valid-branch integration (regime establishment via existential δ_lipschitz + matrixLog-in-su-d guards) + Nat.rec wrap. S93 cubic-term-through-Vn + S94 stability-term wrapper + S95 combine assembly: inductive-step telescoping ASSEMBLED; only numeric chain + Nat.rec wrap remain for (B). S91 = stability M-bound + poly F/G-norms; S92 = composition identity (inductive-step structural core). Remaining (B): telescoping core + numeric chain + Nat.rec wrap (carrying regime hypothesis). S90 = K_F polynomial bound (numeric-chain prep). EXISTENTIAL-REGIME finding: main-induction discharge carries explicit `2d·(2ε₀_sud) < δ_lipschitz(d)` regime hypothesis (S60 H-norm is existential-δ; honest, discharged downstream by fine ε-net).

**Sessions 104-108 (SHIPPED 2026-05-27/28 — regime-discharge substrate chain)**: the
**regime hypothesis** `h_regime` is the last conditional carried by the S.6 cascade
(alongside (D) density + length-polylog). These sessions build it toward an
unconditional discharge:
- **S104** (`GenericSUdRegimeGuards.lean`): `negI_smul_isHermitian_of_isSkewHermitian`
  + `negI_matrixLog_isHermitian_traceless_on_nhd_one` — `H = (-i)·log Δ` is
  Hermitian-traceless on a nbhd of 1.
- **S105**: `negI_matrixLog_herm_traceless_on_residual_nhd` — same on the residual
  `V⁻¹U` form.
- **S106**: `regime_thetabound_herm_traceless_on_residual_nhd` — adds the Lipschitz
  θ-bound `‖H‖ ≤ 2(n+2)‖V−U‖`.
- **S107** (`4c0ab56`): `regime_predicate_on_residual_nhd` — the **5-conjunct regime
  predicate** (θ-bound ∧ ‖H‖≤1 ∧ Herm ∧ traceless ∧ Δ∈target) on a residual nbhd
  `∃ δ>0, ∀ V U, ‖V−U‖<δ → …`, composing S106 + the ‖H‖≤1 derivation + target
  membership via `residual_norm_le_d_mul` + `expAmbientPartialHomeo_target_mem_nhds_one`.
- **S108** (`9a06ffa`): **DROPPED the `0 < ‖H‖` conjunct** from the super-quad chain
  (S84/S86/cubic_term/S101/S102/S103). This fixes a real defect — `h_regime` was
  UNIVERSALLY FALSE at `V = U` (where `H = 0`), so it could never be discharged
  unconditionally on the calibration ball. S84 now case-splits internally: at `H=0`
  the target round-trip forces `Δ=1`, the DN step gives `F=G=0`, and `exp(-[0,0])=1=Δ`.
  The cascade's `h_regime` now matches the exact 5-conjunct shape S107 proves.

**⚠️ Regime concrete-radius gap (the genuine remaining blocker)**: S107 gives the
regime predicate on a residual neighborhood of **existential radius** (`matrixLog` is
the IFT local inverse `(expAmbientPartialHomeo).symm`, whose `.target` is an
existential open set from `HasStrictFDerivAt.toOpenPartialHomeomorph`). The cascade's
`h_regime` needs it on the **calibration ball** `‖V−U‖ ≤ 2·ε₀_sud`. Bridging requires
a **concrete-radius matrix logarithm** (the Mercator power series
`log(1+X)=Σ(-1)^{k+1}X^k/k`, convergent for `‖X‖<1` with a *named* radius) replacing
the IFT `matrixLog`, plus its Lipschitz tail bound — a genuine multi-session
Mathlib-gap substrate (Mathlib has no Banach-algebra log with a known radius). The
existential radius cannot be made quantitative (no nameable lower bound), so no choice
of `K`/`ε₀` closes it; only a concrete construction does.

**Truly remaining substantive work (post S108 — (B) is DISCHARGED; 4 named items + 1 review)**:
  0. **(B) Super-quad MAIN INDUCTION discharge ✓ DONE** (S102 `SkApproxCSuperQuadraticBound_generic_sud_holds`, fed to the cascade by S103). Calibration resolved by S88 (`K_compose_sud = 1024·d^16`). No longer a blocker.
  1. **Regime concrete-radius substrate** (the closest-to-done headline blocker) — replace the IFT `matrixLog` with a concrete-radius Mercator power-series matrix log to bridge S107's existential-radius regime predicate to the calibration ball `‖V−U‖ ≤ 2·ε₀_sud`. **Brick 1 SHIPPED (S109, `e37ad01`, `GenericSUdMatrixMercatorLog.lean`)**: `matrixMercatorLog X = ∑'(-1)^n/(n+1)•X^(n+1)` with named-radius convergence (`summable_matrixMercatorLog` for `‖X‖<1`) + explicit bound `‖·‖ ≤ ‖X‖/(1−‖X‖)` + concrete-radius K=2 Lipschitz `‖·‖ ≤ 2‖X‖` on `‖X‖≤1/2`. **Brick 2a SHIPPED (S110, `de322c9`)**: `matrixMercatorLog_commute_self` (`Commute X (matrixMercatorLog X)`) + `matrixMercatorLog_commute_one_add` — the commutation the round-trip's exp-path derivative needs. **Brick 2 ✅ COMPLETE (S109-S118)**: `exp_matrixMercatorLog : ‖X‖<1 → exp(matrixMercatorLog X) = 1+X` (S118, `6867dc8`) + all derivative substrate (crux iii S114, crux iv S115/S116, f'=0 S117). The Mercator log is a proven CONCRETE-RADIUS right-inverse of exp on the named ball `‖X‖<1`.

  **🚨🚨 BRICK 3 ARCHITECTURAL FINDING (Session 119 — the concrete-radius approach does NOT escape the existential wall for the regime AS STATED) 🚨🚨**: brick 3 was to prove `matrixLog d Δ = matrixMercatorLog (Δ−1)` on the *concrete* calibration ball, transferring the K=2 θ-bound + `Δ∈target` to the IFT log the regime uses. **This is impossible without a refactor.** The IFT `matrixLog d Δ = (expAmbientPartialHomeo d).symm Δ`; the agreement requires `matrixMercatorLog(Δ−1) ∈ source` (then homeo-injectivity gives equality, since both exponentiate to Δ via `exp_matrixMercatorLog` + `expAmbient_matrixLog`). But `source`/`target`/the IFT norm-bound are **irreducibly existential** (`HasStrictFDerivAt.toOpenPartialHomeomorph` gives no nameable radius). So the agreement holds only on an existential sub-ball `‖Δ−1‖<ρ/2` — **the original wall**. Concrete exp-injectivity (even via a reverse round-trip `mLog(exp A−1)=A`) does NOT help: it still requires `‖matrixLog d Δ‖ < r₀` to apply, and that bound is existential for the IFT log. **The dependency is circular: nothing about the concrete Mercator log can bound the IFT log concretely.** The regime predicate (`h_regime` in S102/cascade) is stated with the IFT `matrixLog d` + IFT `target`, so it CANNOT be discharged on the concrete `2·ε₀` ball via brick 3.

  **CORRECT PATH (re-point to the concrete log — multi-session):** define `matrixLogConcrete d Δ := matrixMercatorLog (Δ − 1)` (concrete by construction), re-derive the regime substrate against it — θ-bound via `norm_matrixMercatorLog_le_two_mul` (K=2, CONCRETE radius `‖Δ−1‖≤1/2`); "Δ ∈ target" becomes the CONCRETE ball `‖Δ−1‖<1`; Hermitian-traceless of `(-i)·matrixMercatorLog(Δ−1)` for unitary Δ re-derived from the explicit series (`(Δ−1)^(n+1)` terms, vs. the existential `matrixLog-in-su-d` substrate S104-106) — and **re-point `dnStepFG_sud` (S82) + the (B) discharge (S102) + the regime hypothesis to `matrixLogConcrete`**. This makes the regime CONCRETE-radius (discharges on `‖Δ−1‖ ≤ d·2ε₀ < 1`) ⟹ `h_regime` UNCONDITIONAL ⟹ S.6/T-X′.5 reduce to (D)+length only. The Mercator-log substrate (S109-S118) is **exactly the foundation** for this re-point (not wasted) AND a standalone Mathlib-PR-quality concrete matrix logarithm. **Scope: a large multi-session refactor** of the dnStep/(B)/regime chain — the genuine route to the unconditional headline.

  **Re-point sub-brick breakdown (S119 scouting — for efficient next-session execution):**
  - **R0** `matrixLogConcrete d Δ := matrixMercatorLog (Δ−1)` + API: round-trip
    `exp(matrixLogConcrete Δ)=Δ` (= `exp_matrixMercatorLog`, ‖Δ−1‖<1), `matrixLogConcrete 1 = 0`
    (= `matrixMercatorLog_zero`), θ-bound `‖(-i)·matrixLogConcrete Δ‖ ≤ 2‖Δ−1‖` on `‖Δ−1‖≤1/2`
    (= `norm_matrixMercatorLog_le_two_mul`). ~easy (wrappers).
  - **R1 TRACELESS** `det Δ = 1 → trace(matrixMercatorLog(Δ−1)) = 0` (‖Δ−1‖ small so |trace|<2π).
    ⚠️ **Mathlib GAP confirmed (S119): `det(exp A) = exp(trace A)` is NOT in Mathlib** (no
    `Matrix.det_exp`/`det(NormedSpace.exp _)` lemma). Must be proven (~100 LoC via diagonalization,
    cf. S49's forward `expIsud_det_eq_one_predicate_holds`), then `det Δ = exp(trace(mLog(Δ−1)))=1`
    + `Complex.exp_eq_one_iff` + `|trace A| ≤ d·‖A‖` smallness ⟹ trace = 0.
  - **✅✅ R2 SKEW-HERMITIAN / HERMITIAN CONJUNCT — SHIPPED (S121 + S125-S127)** `(matrixMercatorLog (Δ−1))ᴴ
    = −matrixMercatorLog(Δ−1)` for unitary Δ ⟹ `((-i)·matrixMercatorLog(Δ−1)).IsHermitian`.
    Part (a) **SHIPPED S121** (`6815803` predecessor): `matrixMercatorLog_conjTranspose : mLog(Y)ᴴ
    = mLog(Yᴴ)` UNCONDITIONALLY (star commutes with the tsum via `conjTranspose_tsum`; c_n real via
    `star_div₀`/`star_pow` — no norm hypotheses needed since junk-`0` on both sides when the series
    diverges). Part (b) **SHIPPED S125** (`6815803`): `matrixMercatorLog_inv_eq_neg` — for commuting
    A,B with `(1+A)(1+B)=1` and `‖A‖,‖B‖≤1/8`, `mLog B = −mLog A` (= `log(Δ⁻¹)=−log(Δ)`) via the R3
    exp-injectivity below. **Generic Hermitian SHIPPED S126** (`365fe2c`):
    `isHermitian_neg_I_smul_matrixMercatorLog_of_unitary` — two-sided unitary Δ (`Δ·Δᴴ=1, Δᴴ·Δ=1`)
    + `‖Δ−1‖,‖Δᴴ−1‖≤1/8` ⟹ `((-i)•mLog(Δ−1)).IsHermitian` (compose R2a+R2b; `star(-i)=i` turns
    skew→Herm). **SU(d) wrapper SHIPPED S127** (`c1b0873`): `isHermitian_regime_concrete_sud` — for
    `V,U∈SU(d)` with `d²·‖V−U‖≤1/8`, `((-i)•mLog((V⁻¹U).val−1)).IsHermitian` (unitary via
    `specialUnitaryGroup_le_unitaryGroup`; `‖Δ−1‖,‖Δᴴ−1‖` via `residual_norm_le_d_mul` + `Δᴴ−1=−Δᴴ(Δ−1)`
    + `‖Δᴴ‖≤d`). **The re-pointed regime's HERMITIAN conjunct is now CONCRETE-RADIUS UNCONDITIONAL.**
  - **✅✅ R3 CONCRETE EXP-INJECTIVITY — SHIPPED (S123 + S124)** `eq_zero_of_exp_eq_one_of_norm_le :
    NormedSpace.exp S = 1 ∧ ‖S‖≤1/2 ⟹ S = 0` (`d9f214a`). Took the **one-point** route (not full
    two-point injectivity): `exp S = 1` gives `exp S − 1 − S = −S`; the **Banach exp-remainder bound**
    `norm_exp_sub_one_sub_self_le : ‖exp A − 1 − A‖ ≤ ‖A‖²·Real.exp‖A‖` (S123, `~80` LoC, Mathlib-PR-worthy
    — no Banach exp-remainder lemma exists; proved via the exp tsum split `Summable.sum_add_tsum_nat_add 2`
    + termwise `((i+2)!)⁻¹≤(i!)⁻¹`, `norm_pow_le'` + matching `Real.exp` tail `Real.summable_pow_div_factorial`)
    gives `‖S‖ ≤ ‖S‖²·exp‖S‖`, i.e. `1 ≤ ‖S‖·exp‖S‖`; but `‖S‖·exp‖S‖ ≤ (1/2)·exp(1/2) < (1/2)·2 = 1`
    (via `exp(1/2)²=exp 1`, `Real.exp_one_lt_d9`), contradiction unless `‖S‖=0`. **This is the
    concrete-radius substitute for the existential IFT local injectivity** — fed directly into R2b (S125).
  - **✅✅ R1 TRACELESS — SHIPPED (S128, `ddfe9e4`)** `matrixMercatorLog_trace_eq_zero_of_unitary :
    det Δ = 1 ∧ ‖Δ−1‖,‖Δᴴ−1‖≤1/8 ∧ d·‖Δ−1‖<π → trace(matrixMercatorLog(Δ−1)) = 0`. **KEY: the
    `det(exp A) = exp(trace A)` "Mathlib gap" was already filled in the PROJECT** —
    `det_exp_skewHermitian` (Track S.2d, `GenericSUdDetExpSkewHerm.lean`, via spectral decomposition)
    proves it for skew-Hermitian Y. So R1 reduces to: `Y = matrixMercatorLog(Δ−1)` is skew-Hermitian
    (`matrixMercatorLog_isSkewHermitian_of_unitary`, extracted from S126); Jacobi gives
    `exp(tr Y) = det(exp Y) = det Δ = 1` (round-trip `exp_matrixMercatorLog` + `Complex.exp_eq_one_iff`);
    trace bound `‖tr Y‖ ≤ d·‖Y‖ ≤ 2d‖Δ−1‖ < 2π` (`norm_trace_le_dim_mul_norm` + K=2) forces the integer
    multiple to 0. **SU(d) wrapper `regime_herm_traceless_concrete_sud`** combines Hermitian (S127) +
    traceless under the single hypothesis `d²·‖V−U‖≤1/8` (gives `d·‖Δ−1‖≤1/8<π` since `Real.pi_gt_three`).
  - **✅✅ ALL FOUR re-pointed regime conjuncts CONCRETE-RADIUS UNCONDITIONAL**: θ-bound (S120),
    `‖H‖≤1` (S122), Hermitian + traceless = `H ∈ 𝔰𝔲(d)` (S121+S125-S128). The concrete regime guard
    `regime_herm_traceless_concrete_sud` is the drop-in replacement for the existential IFT guard
    `negI_matrixLog_herm_traceless_on_residual_nhd` (S105).
  - **R4 RE-POINT — IN PROGRESS (foundation + exp-delta SHIPPED S129/S130)**. Key structural insight
    (S129): the DN step is **log-agnostic** — `matrixLog (n+2) Δ.val` enters `dnStepFG_sud` only as the
    matrix `M` with `H = (-i)·M` fed to the bounded keystone, and the only matrix-log-*specific*
    downstream fact is the round-trip `exp M = Δ`. So **factor over `M`** instead of duplicating the
    super-quad chain:
    - **✅ S129 (`3acd51d`, `GenericSUdDnStepFGFromLog.lean`)** `dnStepFG_fromLog M` + `dnStepFG_sud_eq_fromLog`
      (`dnStepFG_sud V_n U = dnStepFG_fromLog (matrixLog …)` **by `rfl`** — recovers the IFT chain for free)
      + `dnStepFG_fromLog_commutator_identity_valid` (`[F,G] = -M`, keystone-algebraic) +
      `_invalid_F_G_zero` + `_exp_neg_comm_eq_Delta` (`exp(-[F,G]) = Δ` given the **abstract** round-trip
      `exp M = Δ`, replacing the `target`-gated `expAmbient_matrixLog`).
    - **✅ S130 (`a52e7a6`, `GenericSUdDnStepFGConcrete.lean`)** `dnStepFG_sud_concrete V_n U :=
      dnStepFG_fromLog (matrixMercatorLog ((V_n⁻¹U).val − 1))` + `dnStepFG_sud_concrete_exp_neg_comm_eq_Delta`:
      `exp(-[F,G]) = Δ` **UNCONDITIONAL on the named ball `(n+2)²·‖V_n−U‖ ≤ 1/8`** — the existential
      `Δ ∈ target` wall is GONE (round-trip via `exp_matrixMercatorLog` S118 + concrete regime conjuncts
      S122/S127/S128; smallness via `residual_norm_le_d_mul`).
    - **✅ S131 (`98c71f7`, `GenericSUdDnStepFGFromLogNormBound.lean`)** `dnStepFG_fromLog_{F,G}_norm_le`
      (generic in M, `‖F‖,‖G‖ ≤ K_F·√(θ/2)`, θ=`‖(-i)·M‖`) + `dnStepFG_sud_concrete_{F,G}_norm_le`
      (re-pointed at the concrete log). Keystone-algebraic, mirrors S85.
    - **✅ S132 (`a918dcb`, `GenericSUdDnStepFGConcreteCubic.lean`)** `dnStepFG_sud_concrete_gC_minus_Delta_norm_le_cubic`:
      `‖gC(expIsud F, expIsud G) − Δ‖ ≤ 320·δ³` on the named ball `(n+2)²·‖V_n−U‖≤1/8` — **existential
      `h_regime3` + `Δ∈target` ELIMINATED** (composes the dim-generic BCH cubic with the S130 concrete
      exp-delta). The re-pointed recursion's error-contraction step.
    - **✅✅ ALL THREE concrete single-step ingredients now on the named ball with NO existential
      hypotheses**: exp-delta (S130), F/G-norm (S131), cubic remainder (S132).
    - **✅ S133 (`f50f686`, `GenericSUdSkApproxCConcrete.lean`)** `skApproxC_generic_sud_concrete` — the
      re-pointed SK recursion extracting each level's `(F,G)` via `dnStepFG_sud_concrete` + zero/succ
      unfolding (`rfl`). Foundation for the concrete (B) bound.
    - **✅ S134 (`33f9a4c`, `GenericSUdSuperQuadInductionConcrete.lean`)** concrete induction substrate:
      `skApproxC_generic_sud_concrete_zero_error_bound` (base case, log-agnostic) +
      `dnStepFG_sud_concrete_{F,G}_norm_le_poly` (`(n+2)⁴·√(θ/2)` form, composing S131 + S90).
    - **✅ S135 (`af883b3`)** concrete √ε-form F/G-norm bounds `dnStepFG_sud_concrete_{F,G}_norm_le_sqrt_eps`
      (`‖F‖,‖G‖≤(n+2)^5√ε` given the concrete θ-bound `‖H‖≤2(n+2)ε`); verbatim mirror of S100 via the
      concrete poly norm.
    - **✅ S136 (`ca42f02`)** concrete `cubic_term_through_Vn_concrete` (telescoping term 2:
      `‖ρ(V_n)·gC(A_F,A_G)−U‖≤(n+2)·320·δ³` on the named ball) — existential `h_regime3`+`target`
      ELIMINATED, via the S132 concrete cubic + `Vn_mul_residual_eq_U`/`SUd_val_linftyOpNorm_le`
      (both log-agnostic, reused as-is).
    - **✅ S137 (`bc80590`)** concrete telescoping glue: `skApproxC_generic_sud_concrete_succ_rho_val`
      (S92 analog, ρ_hom unfolding via S87) + `skApproxC_sud_succ_error_le_combine_concrete` (S95 analog,
      triangle through the midpoint `ρ(V_n)·gC(A_F,A_G)` — clean helper, avoids the IFT `set` blocks).
    - **✅✅ S138 (`2c944a8`)** concrete KEYSTONE single-step `skApproxC_sud_succ_super_quad_valid_concrete`:
      `‖ρ(sk_{n+1}^concrete U)−U‖ ≤ K_compose_sud(m+2)·ε^(3/2)` from the IH + concrete θ-bound + the named
      calibration `(m+2)²·‖V_n−U‖≤1/8` + `(m+2)^5√ε≤1`. **Existential `h_regime3`+`Δ∈target` ELIMINATED.**
      Composes √ε-norm (S135) + cubic term (S136) + error-combine (S137) + the log-agnostic stability-term
      (S96) / numeric chain (S99) / near-identity (S85) reused as-is.
    - **✅✅✅ S139 (`76087da`, `GenericSUdSkApproxCBoundConcrete.lean`) — UNCONDITIONAL concrete (B) bound
      SHIPPED**: `SkApproxCSuperQuadraticBound_generic_sud_concrete_holds` (Nat.rec wrap over recursion
      depth applying S138 per level). **Takes NO `h_regime` hypothesis** — the threaded existential
      IFT-log regime the IFT (B) bound (S102) carries is GONE. Each per-level regime obligation is
      discharged internally: the θ-bound from `regime_thetabound_concrete` (S120) + IH; the cubic
      calibration `(m+2)²·‖V_n−U‖≤1/8` from `‖V_n−U‖≤ε_k≤2ε₀_sud` + the new calibration inequalities
      `two_ε₀_sud_mul_le_half` (`(m+2)·2ε₀_sud≤1/2`) + `sq_two_ε₀_sud_mul_le_eighth` (`(m+2)²·2ε₀_sud≤1/8`,
      both from `K_compose_sud_sq_times_two_ε₀_sud` + `K≥1024`); Hermitian/traceless baked into
      `dnStepFG_sud_concrete` via S122/S127/S128. **This is the payoff of the entire re-point (S109–S139):
      the existential regime blocker is eliminated.**
    - **✅✅✅ S140 (`9d0d931`, `GenericSUdSkHeadlineCascadeConcrete.lean`) — R4 CAPSTONE: UNCONDITIONAL
      SU(d) headline cascade SHIPPED**. `SolovayKitaevHeadline_FreeGroup_SUd` is **existential over the
      compile function**, so `skApproxC_generic_sud_concrete` (S133) serves as the compile witness; the
      error bound follows from the unconditional (B) bound (S139) + `skLevel_polylog_sud_spec_holds`; the
      word-length conjunct (F#4) from `h_length_polylog`. Two theorems:
      `skHeadline_FreeGroup_SUd_cascade_final_concrete` (headline from concrete (B) bound + length + cal)
      and **`skHeadline_FreeGroup_SUd_cascade_B_discharged_concrete`** (the UNCONDITIONAL headline from
      **(D) density + length-polylog ONLY — NO `h_regime`**; base finder `findNearestInCover_SUd` + (B)
      bound discharged internally). The existential regime blocker is now eliminated **end-to-end**.
    - **✅ S141 (`cf4cc6b`, `GenericSUdSkApproxCConcreteLength.lean`)** concrete-recursion word-length
      *recurrence + closed-form* bound `skApproxC_generic_sud_concrete_length_{succ,le_skLength_sud}_param`
      (≤ `skLength_sud N₀ 0 n = N₀·5^n`). Word length is log-independent, so the IFT S53 transfers verbatim.
    - **✅✅✅ EXPONENT CAVEAT — RESOLVED 2026-05-28 (user-authorized correctness fix; 3 commits)**: the
      S141-surfaced caveat was diagnosed (fresh literature search + 6 corroborating in-project sources) as a
      **2026-05-27 dev-time mis-transcription** in commit `866396e`: the SU(d) headline forms hardcoded the
      word-length exponent **`log 5 / log 2 ≈ 2.32`** and mis-attributed it to Dawson-Nielsen. The canonical
      Dawson-Nielsen exponent is **`log 5 / log(3/2) ≈ 3.97`** (arXiv:quant-ph/0505030 §3.3: 5× word growth +
      ε^(3/2) contraction), matching the SU(2) `skLengthExponent`, the level chooser `skLevel_polylog_sud`
      (already `log(3/2)`), the Phase 6u roadmap, and the public README. `log 5 / log 2` would require
      quadratic ε² contraction the project does not prove, so it was NEVER achievable — a wrong statement, not
      a harder target. **Fix (3 commits):** (1) `b572711` corrected all 24 occurrences across 17 FKLW files
      `log 5/log 2 → log 5/log(3/2)` + the two `*_skLength_exponent_pos` annotations + mis-attributing
      docstrings; (2) `1b12e67` introduced canonical single-source `GenericSUd.skLengthExponent_sud` (new
      Mathlib-only leaf `GenericSUdSkLengthExponent.lean`, with provenance) and wired
      `SkLengthPolylogBound_sud` + the two former duplicate named defs to it (kills the drift root cause);
      (3) `8093af1` UNCONDITIONALLY DISCHARGED `SkLengthPolylogBound_sud` at the canonical exponent
      (`GenericSUdSkLengthPolylogDischarge.lean::skLengthPolylogBound_sud_holds`, kernel-only `{propext,
      Classical.choice, Quot.sound}`), lifting the SU(2) `skLength_at_skLevel_polylog_le` proof parametrically.
      Build clean 8870 jobs throughout; 0 axioms; 0 sorries.
    - **✅ Length-composition DONE (2026-05-28, commit `9343c15`)**: `concrete_length_polylog_holds`
      (`GenericSUdConcreteLengthPolylog.lean`) discharges the cascade's `h_length_polylog` (F#4 conjunct) by
      composing `skLengthPolylogBound_sud_holds` ∘ S141 ∘ S55 base-finder bound; `skHeadline_FreeGroup_SUd_from_density`
      reduces the headline to (D) density + word-length bundle (kernel-only).
    - **✅ Per-alphabet headline-of-witness DONE (2026-05-28, commit `45b793c`)**:
      `trappedIonSU4_headline_of_witness` / `cliffordCCZSU8_headline_of_witness`
      (`GenericSUdPerAlphabetHeadlineFromWitness.lean`) reduce the SU(4)/SU(8) UNCONDITIONAL headlines to a
      single input — a `ClosureDenseWitness` for the alphabet (densityFromWitness is unconditional since Cartan
      S.2g is discharged). (B), regime, F#4 length, density-from-witness all internal; kernel-only.
    - **REMAINING — the SOLE substantive frontier: the (D) `ClosureDenseWitness` discharge.** The named
      UNCONDITIONAL headlines `solovayKitaev_dawson_nielsen_quantitative_su{4,8}_..._tight` now follow IMMEDIATELY
      from `trappedIonSU4_headline_of_witness` / `cliffordCCZSU8_headline_of_witness` once the per-alphabet
      `ClosureDenseWitness` is constructed UNCONDITIONALLY (currently the tracked Props
      `trappedIonSU4_v4_witness_tracked` / `cliffordCCZSU8_v4_witness_tracked`). This is the deep universality
      math — Brylinski-Brylinski 2002 (SU(4) MS+1Q entangler universality) / Aaronson-Gottesman 2004 (SU(8)
      Clifford+CCZ) — requiring the `ClosureDenseWitness` fields: spanning 𝔰𝔲(d) tangents + flow-line
      containment `exp(t·Xᵢ) ∈ H_of_G gs`. Genuinely multi-session; this is the keystone remaining ingredient
      for the whole phase + the M-S substantive extraction + Stage-13.
    - **Deep-research blueprint REQUESTED 2026-05-28** for the (D) witness discharge (per CLAUDE.md hard-proof
      protocol): `Lit-Search/tasks/submitted/phase6y_closure_dense_witness_su4_su8_blueprint.md` — asks for the
      explicit 𝔰𝔲(4)/𝔰𝔲(8) tangent set, the `hX_spans` finite-linear-algebra certificate, and the `hX_flow`
      universality lemma chain (Brylinski-Brylinski / Aaronson-Gottesman), Mathlib-v4.29.1-hooked. Once it
      returns, the witness term feeds `trappedIonSU4_headline_of_witness` / `cliffordCCZSU8_headline_of_witness`
      (shipped `45b793c`) to close the named headlines immediately.

    - **🎯 T-A2′ SU(8) RESOLUTION (2026-05-28, user-authorized) — ship A′ now + DR-spike literal.** The
      literal roadmap alphabet for instance (2) was `{H_q1,H_q2,H_q3, CCZ}`, which is **non-universal** (OF-1:
      every word ∈ μ₁₆·O(8), dense only in SO(8) — its witness is mathematically FALSE). The **faithful**
      literal set is `{H,S,CNOT,CCZ}` (full Clifford+CCZ, universal by **Shi 2002 / Aharonov 2003**;
      Brylinski-Brylinski 2001 give the entangling-gate criterion. NB: Boykin et al 1999 is the
      Clifford+**T** basis, NOT Clifford+CCZ — cite it only for the A′ Clifford+T density, not here). Decision (user, 2026-05-28): **(a) ship the SU(8) instance NOW on the
      universal alphabet A′ `{H_qi, T_qi, CNOT_ij, CCZ}` (Clifford+CCZ+T)**, which has per-qubit Clifford+T
      density (Phase 6u, shipped) ⟹ continuous per-qubit flows for free ⟹ `ClosureDenseWitness` UNCONDITIONAL,
      kernel-only, via conjugation spread (NO Trotter needed); **AND (b) commission a DR spike for the faithful
      literal `{H,S,CNOT,CCZ}`**. **Honest labeling (REQUIRED):** A′ ships "**Clifford+T at SU(8)**" — its
      density comes entirely from the `{H,T,CNOT}` subset; **CCZ is over-complete and is unused in the witness
      construction** (verified: 0 refs to `CCZ_SU` in any `CliffordCCZSU8{PerQubitFlow,PerQubitContainment,
      EntanglerSpread,FactorConj,TangentSpan}.lean`). A′ therefore does **not** deliver instance (2)'s "CCZ
      compiled not primitive" intent; that is the literal follow-on. The reason literal is hard is NOT Trotter:
      `{H,S,CNOT,CCZ}` is all finite-order (no per-qubit ∞-order gate), so the FIRST continuous flow must be
      manufactured by a **von Neumann/Kronecker accumulation** of a CCZ·Clifford product word with an
      irrational eigen-angle — Trotter only propagates flows, it cannot seed them. (The prior DR blueprint's
      cheap route-(a) Trotter cost assumed continuous-parameter gates — true for SU(4) MS, false here.)
    - **Deep-research SPIKE REQUESTED 2026-05-28** (literal Clifford+CCZ seed):
      `Lit-Search/Tasks/phase6y_literal_cliffordCCZ_su8_irrational_seed_spike.md` — asks for the explicit
      irrational-angle seed element `g(H,S,CNOT,CCZ) ∈ SU(8)`, its irrationality proof (cyclotomic/Niven), the
      Lean-v4.29.1 formalization strategy (`AddSubgroup.dense_or_cyclic`, `IsPrimitiveRoot`,
      `Polynomial.cyclotomic`, torus-closure → one-parameter subgroup), and how it composes with the
      already-shipped (reusable, alphabet-agnostic) A′ conjugation spread + Trotter propagation. Returns →
      literal `{H,S,CNOT,CCZ}` witness → faithful instance (2) as a tracked strengthening.

  **⚠️ Brick 2 (round-trip) — KEY OBSTRUCTION + EXECUTABLE PLAN (for the next dedicated session)**: Mathlib's clean exp-derivative `hasFDerivAt_exp` (`NormedSpace.exp x • 1` at `x`) requires **`NormedCommRing 𝔸`** — the matrix algebra `Matrix (Fin d) (Fin d) ℂ` is **non-commutative**, so it does NOT apply directly (the non-commutative `d/dt exp(A(t))` is the integral `∫₀¹ exp(sA)·A'·exp((1−s)A) ds`, simplifying to `exp(A)·A'` ONLY when `A,A'` commute — which is why S110's commutation was shipped first). **Recommended route**: the derivative argument `f(t) = exp(−matrixMercatorLog(t•X))·(1 + t•X)`, `f'(t)=0`, `f(0)=1` ⟹ `f(1)=1`, restricted to the **commutative closed subalgebra `A_X` generated by `X`** (where `matrixMercatorLog(t•X)`, its derivative `X·(1+t•X)⁻¹` via Neumann, and `1+t•X` all live and pairwise commute), so `hasFDerivAt_exp` applies inside `A_X`. **Enabling Mathlib lemmas identified**: `hasFDerivAt_exp` (commutative exp deriv — applies INSIDE `A_X` only), `mul_neg_geom_series (x) (‖x‖<1) : (1−x)·∑'xⁿ = 1` + `Summable.one_sub_mul_tsum_pow`/`.tsum_pow_mul_one_sub` (Neumann inverse — **already off-the-shelf for the matrix algebra, do NOT re-derive**; gives `(1+t•X)⁻¹ = ∑(−t•X)ⁿ` for the log-derivative), `NormedRing.inverse_one_sub` + `hasFPowerSeriesOnBall_inverse_one_sub`, `HasFPowerSeriesOnBall.hasFDerivAt` (term-by-term differentiation of `matrixMercatorLog(t•X)`). The two HARD crux steps with no off-the-shelf lemma: (iii) `HasDerivAt (fun t => matrixMercatorLog (t•X)) (X·(1+t•X)⁻¹) t` (term-by-term differentiation of the log power series), and (iv) `HasDerivAt (fun t => exp(A(t))) (exp(A(t))·A'(t)) t` for commuting `A,A'` (the commutative-subalgebra exp-path derivative — `hasFDerivAt_exp` needs `NormedCommRing`). Substantial multi-lemma analytic substrate — a dedicated session.

  **⚠️⚠️ Crux (iii) ROOT-CAUSE finding (Sessions 112-113 attempts — instance-pollution diamond)**: the per-term derivative `HasDerivAt (fun s : ℝ => c_n • ((↑s:ℂ)•X)^(n+1)) (((-1)^n·(↑s)^n) • X^(n+1)) s` is mathematically clean (coefficient `(n+1)·c_n = (-1)^n` collapses; assemble via `Complex.ofRealCLM.hasDerivAt` + `HasDerivAt.pow` + `HasDerivAt.smul_const`). **THE DEEP BLOCKER (diagnosed via `lean_run_code`)**: `Matrix.linftyOpNormedAddCommGroup` (a *local instance* the whole file needs for `‖·‖`) supplies its OWN `AddCommGroup` and hence its own ℝ-module path (`NormedSpace.complexToReal`-derived, `inst.toModule`), which is a **NON-DEFEQ diamond** with the standard `Matrix.addCommGroup`/Pi ℝ-module that the goal and the `Complex.ofRealCLM`/`smul_const` calculus machinery resolve to. Concretely: `smul_const`'s output `HasDerivAt` lands in `linftyOpNormedAddCommGroup.toAddCommGroup`+`inst2.toModule`, but the goal (post-`rw`) sits in `Matrix.addCommGroup`+default `module` — `exact` fails with a genuine type mismatch, and the surfaced "`IsScalarTower ℝ ℂ (Matrix ℂ)` not synthesized" is a *symptom* of `smul_const` searching the tower over the wrong module path. **This is instance pollution specific to doing CALCULUS (ℝ-module + norm together) on `Matrix ℂ` under the linftyOp norm** — bare `inferInstance` finds each instance, but `smul_const` mixes the two module diamonds. **✅ RESOLVED (Session 112, `ec55dbb`)**: option (c) — bundle the ℂ-smul into a continuous ℝ-linear map `g : ℂ →L[ℝ] Matrix ℂ`, `g z = z • X^(n+1)` (`(id ℂ).smulRight (X^(n+1)) |>.restrictScalars ℝ`), and differentiate via `g.hasFDerivAt.comp_hasDerivAt` — sidesteps `smul_const` and the module diamond entirely. `hasDerivAt_matrixMercatorLog_term` SHIPPED (per-term derivative `d/dt[c_n•((↑t)•X)^(n+1)] = ((-1)^n·(↑t)^n)•X^(n+1)`, kernel-only). **✅ CRUX (iii) COMPLETE (Sessions 113-114, `78f93bb`/`61a02bd`)**: `summable_matrixMercatorLog_deriv_series` + `tsum_matrixMercatorLog_deriv_eq` (`∑' ((-1)^n(↑t)^n)•X^(n+1) = (1+(↑t)•X)⁻¹·X` via `geom_series_eq_inverse`) + `hasDerivAt_matrixMercatorLog_path` (`d/dt[matrixMercatorLog((↑t)•X)] = (1+(↑t)•X)⁻¹·X` for `|t|·‖X‖<1`, assembled via `hasDerivAt_tsum_of_isPreconnected` on `ball 0 R`, `|t|<R<1/‖X‖`). **✅ CRUX (iv) COMPLETE (Session 115, `df209e7`)**: `hasDerivAt_exp_path` — `d/dt[exp(A t)] = exp(A t₀)·A'` for a commuting path (eventual-commute form, S116 `b842a73`). **✅✅ BRICK 2 COMPLETE — EXP/LOG ROUND-TRIP SHIPPED (Session 118, `6867dc8`)**: `exp_matrixMercatorLog : ‖X‖<1 → NormedSpace.exp (matrixMercatorLog X) = 1 + X`. Built across S116-S118: `hasDerivAt_exp_neg_matrixMercatorLog_path` (u'(t)) + `hasDerivAt_one_add_smul` (v'(t)=X) + `hasDerivAt_round_trip_factor` (f'≡0 via product rule + `(1+Y)⁻¹·X·(1+Y)=X` cancellation) + `Convex.is_const_of_fderivWithin_eq_zero` on `ball 0 (1/‖X‖)` + extraction via `exp_add_of_commute`. The Mercator log is now a CONCRETE-RADIUS right-inverse of exp (shifted by 1) on the NAMED ball `‖X‖<1` — the concrete-radius analog of the existential IFT `expAmbient_matrixLog`. **Remaining brick 3**: identify `matrixMercatorLog(Δ−1) = matrixLog d Δ` for `Δ` near `1` (via local injectivity of exp near 0 — both `mLog(Δ−1)` and `matrixLog d Δ` exponentiate to `Δ`, and exp is injective on a concrete ball — using `exp_matrixMercatorLog` + `expAmbient_matrixLog`) + a concrete ball ⊆ `target`, discharging the regime θ-bound (`norm_matrixMercatorLog_le_two_mul`, K=2) + `Δ∈target` on the concrete calibration ball. **Historical re-scope options (now moot for crux iii, but relevant if crux iv hits the same diamond — it won't, same CLM fix applies)**: (a) reconcile the diamond — prove `linftyOpNormedAddCommGroup.toAddCommGroup`'s ℝ-module is defeq/`Subsingleton`-equal to the standard one and force one path via `@`-explicit instances or `convert ... using 1` + `AddCommGroup`-congruence (painful but local); (b) **PIVOT to a non-derivative round-trip proof** (Cauchy product of the exp/log series, or the dense-diagonalizable + continuity route) that avoids ℝ-module calculus entirely — likely the cleaner path given the diamond; (c) prove the round-trip in a norm whose `NormedAddCommGroup` shares the standard Matrix `AddCommGroup` (e.g. a Pi/Frobenius norm) then transfer the equation (norm-independent) back. The mathematical skeleton (Neumann `(1+t•X)⁻¹` off-the-shelf; `hasDerivAt_tsum_of_isPreconnected` on `ball 0 (1/‖X‖)`) is unchanged once the module path is settled.
  2. **(D-SU4) Density witness at SU(4) trapped-ion** — Brylinski-Brylinski 2002 entangler universality. Multi-session entangler-theoretic content.
  3. **(D-SU8) Density witness at SU(8) Clifford+CCZ** — Aaronson-Gottesman 2004 Clifford-stabilizer lineage. Multi-session.
  4. **Length-bound polylog exponent caveat** — ✅ RESOLVED 2026-05-28 (commits `b572711`/`1b12e67`/`8093af1`):
     corrected `log 5/log 2 → log 5/log(3/2)`, single-sourced via `skLengthExponent_sud`, and UNCONDITIONALLY
     discharged `SkLengthPolylogBound_sud` at the canonical exponent. Remaining length work is just the
     S141-composition (a) above, not an exponent decision.
  5. **Stage-13 fresh-context adversarial review pass** — CLOSURE gate; dispatched ONLY after items 1-3 ship (i.e. once the UNCONDITIONAL S.6/T-X′.5 headlines exist).

### Wave 1 Session-handoff contract

Per [[feedback-multi-session-wave-pattern]]: when picking up Wave 1, FIRST:
1. Read this §"Wave 1" block end-to-end.
2. Read the latest session memory (`project_phase6y_session_*.md` — most recent date).
3. Verify the latest committed Lean module(s) compile (`lake build` from `lean/`).
4. Proceed to next-session PENDING items (per §"Wave 1 Plan" above).
5. Each session ships build-clean modules + per-session memory entry.

The stop hook from the controlling `/goal` is the **session-end indicator**, NOT a "keep grinding" signal — when it fires, save per-session memory, commit, end the session cleanly. A new session in fresh context picks up the next Wave 1 item per the handoff contract.
