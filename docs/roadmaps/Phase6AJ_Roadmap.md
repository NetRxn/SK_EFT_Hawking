# Phase 6AJ — Fidelity-domain data processing (MOONSHOT E, public)

**Status:** PLANNED (opened 2026-06-02). Public-only. Lifts the general-state network monotonicity
from the trace-distance domain (shipped: `traceDist_applyChain_le`) into the **fidelity** domain, so
a downstream chain certificate can live in fidelity, not only trace distance.

**The target.** Uhlmann's monotonicity / data-processing inequality for fidelity: for any CPTP map
`Φ` and density operators `ρ, σ`,
`F(Φρ, Φσ) ≥ F(ρ, σ)`  (equivalently `sqrtFidelity(Φρ,Φσ) ≥ sqrtFidelity(ρ,σ)`),
and then the chain corollary mirroring `traceDist_applyChain_le`:
`sqrtFidelity(applyChain K ρ, applyChain K σ) ≥ sqrtFidelity(ρ, σ)` (fidelity is non-decreasing along
a CPTP network — the opposite monotone direction from trace distance).

**Why it's a moonshot.** Fidelity DP is genuinely harder than trace-distance DP. The standard proofs
go through (i) Uhlmann's theorem (fidelity = max overlap over purifications) + Stinespring, or (ii) an
integral / variational representation of fidelity, or (iii) operator-concavity / joint concavity of
fidelity (Lieb). Pinned Mathlib likely lacks all three packaged. We DO have, as scaffolding: the
Uhlmann `sqrtFidelity` definition + `sqrtFidelity_eq_traceNormOf` (`F = ‖√σ√ρ‖₁`), the trace-norm
machinery, CPTP/Kraus model, and trace-distance DP (`traceDist_krausMap_le`).

**Invariants:** kernel-pure; **NO new project-local axiom without explicit user sign-off**;
fence-discipline (interactive lean4 scouting + written blocker for any new fence). If the full DP
inequality is unreachable, a strictly-weaker-but-honest deliverable (e.g. fidelity DP for the
restricted unital / mixed-unitary case, or a joint-concavity lemma) is acceptable and must be labeled
as the restricted result, not the general one.

## Wave 6AJ.0 — Mathlib scouting (interactive lean4 skill, NOT deep research)
Via `lean_local_search`/`lean_leansearch`/`lean_loogle`: search for purifications, Uhlmann's theorem,
Stinespring dilation, joint concavity of fidelity, operator concavity (`OperatorConcave`/Löwner),
`√` operator-monotonicity (Ando), and any fidelity monotonicity already in Mathlib's quantum-info /
matrix-analysis corner. Output: present/absent table with exact names. This decides the route.

## Wave 6AJ.1 — Route selection + core inequality
Pick the most-supported route:
- **(a) Operator-monotone / Ando route:** if `√` operator-monotonicity + a Kraus-map Löwner argument
  are reachable, prove DP directly on `F = ‖√σ√ρ‖₁` via the trace-norm contraction already used for
  `traceDist_krausMap_le` (the pos/neg-part / dual-norm keystone may transfer).
- **(b) Block-matrix / joint-concavity route:** prove joint concavity of `(ρ,σ) ↦ F(ρ,σ)` (Lieb) and
  derive DP from concavity + the channel as an average of unitaries (for the mixed-unitary subclass)
  or via the Choi/dilation if reachable.
- **(c) Uhlmann-purification route:** only if Stinespring/purification is reachable in pin (likely not).
Headline `sqrtFidelity_krausMap_ge` (CPTP fidelity DP), with hypotheses honestly scoped to whatever
subclass the chosen route supports.

## Wave 6AJ.2 — Chain corollary + symmetry with trace-distance
`sqrtFidelity_applyChain_ge` mirroring `traceDist_applyChain_le`; note the monotone-direction duality
(trace distance ↓, fidelity ↑) consistent with FvdG. Recommend (do not scope) the private chain cert
gain a fidelity-domain branch.

## Wave 6AJ.3 — Consolidation
Headline(s) + D6 §6 + preprint update; Stage-13.

---

## Phase exit (two acceptable outcomes)
EITHER (a) general (or honestly-scoped restricted) fidelity DP `sqrtFidelity_krausMap_ge` + the chain
corollary, PROVEN kernel-pure; OR (b) a fence with an interactive-lean4-verified written blocker and
the partial deliverable (e.g. joint concavity, or the restricted-subclass DP) clearly labeled. NO
axiom without sign-off. Counts/docs/memory synced.

## OUTCOME (2026-06-02, autonomous /goal) — reversible-channel fidelity DP SHIPPED; general/mixed-unitary ROUTE MAPPED (continuation, not fenced)

**Wave 6AJ.0 scout (interactive lean4 on Mathlib v4.29.1).** PRESENT: operator-monotone
`CFC.monotone_sqrt`. ABSENT (verified — leansearch/loogle): joint concavity of fidelity, operator
convexity of `t⁻¹` (Choi's inequality), Lieb concavity, purification / Stinespring dilation. ⟹ the
general-CPTP and mixed-unitary Uhlmann-monotonicity routes all lack a ready theorem.

**SHIPPED (constructive, the reachable toehold):** `FidelityDataProcessing.lean` (root-imported,
kernel-pure) — fidelity is exactly invariant under unitary conjugation, i.e. data processing for the
*reversible* (unitary-channel) subclass as an EQUALITY:
- `posSemidef_unitary_conj`: `U M Uᴴ ⪰ 0`.
- `psdSqrt_unitary_conj`: `√(U M Uᴴ) = U √M Uᴴ` (via `posSemidef_eq_of_mul_self_eq` — NO CFC
  conjugation lemma needed, dodging the Mathlib gap).
- `absOp_unitary_conj`: `|U A Uᴴ| = U |A| Uᴴ`.
- `traceNorm_unitary_conj`: `‖U A Uᴴ‖₁ = ‖A‖₁` (modulus conjugation + trace cyclicity).
- `sqrtFidelity_unitary_conj`: **`F(UρUᴴ, UσUᴴ) = F(ρ, σ)`** — the headline reversible-channel DP.

**ROUTE MAPPED — general/mixed-unitary monotonicity is an in-progress continuation, NOT a fence
(Explore fan-out 2026-06-02).** The most reachable route is the **block-PSD / Alberti SDP form**
`F(ρ,σ) = max{ Re tr X : [[ρ, X],[Xᴴ, σ]] ⪰ 0 }`. Mathlib ships the Schur-complement support
(`Matrix.PosDef.fromBlocks₂₂` / `fromBlocks₁₁`, `schur_complement_eq₁₁/₂₂`,
`LinearAlgebra/Matrix/PosDef.lean` + `…/Hermitian.lean`) and the conjugation-monotonicity bricks
(`star_left_conjugate_le_conjugate`, `conjugate_le_conjugate_of_nonneg`, `Matrix.PosSemidef.kronecker`).
With the block characterization, mixed-unitary monotonicity is immediate (conjugate the feasible `X` by
`∑ pᵢ Uᵢ`, same trace) and joint concavity drops out. NO joint concavity / Lieb / Stinespring needed
for the mixed-unitary case.

**Brick sequence (continuation — precisely pinned):**
1. ✅ **DONE** `fidelityBlock_posDef_schur` (`FidelityBlockForm.lean`, commit `6e19aae1`): for `σ`
   PosDef, `[[ρ,X],[Xᴴ,σ]] ⪰ 0 ↔ ρ − X σ⁻¹ Xᴴ ⪰ 0` (wraps Mathlib `PosDef.fromBlocks₂₂`,
   `PosDef.isUnit` for invertibility). Exhibits `X = √ρ K √σ`, `KKᴴ = ρ^{-½}(Xσ⁻¹Xᴴ)ρ^{-½} ⪯ 1`.
2. ✅ **DONE** `fidelityBlock_mixedUnitary_posSemidef` (TRANSPORT, commit `676791f9`): feasible `X`
   for `(ρ,σ)` ⟹ `∑pᵢUᵢXUᵢᴴ` feasible for `(Φρ,Φσ)`, via `diagDil`/`fidelityBlock_sum_smul`.
3. **NEXT — op-norm/trace-norm Hölder `‖K·M‖₁ ≤ ‖K‖ · ‖M‖₁`** (the genuine new analytic brick).
   ROUTE (verified reachable, NO SVD): `|KM| = √(Mᴴ(KᴴK)M) ⪯ √(‖K‖²·MᴴM) = ‖K‖·|M|` by
   **operator-monotone √** (Mathlib `CFC.monotone_sqrt`, bridged to the project's `psdSqrt` — or a
   direct `psdSqrt`-monotone lemma) on the conjugation `Mᴴ(KᴴK)M ⪯ ‖K‖²MᴴM` (from `KᴴK ⪯ ‖K‖²·1`
   + `conjTranspose_mul_mul_same` Loewner-monotone), then `tr|KM| ≤ ‖K‖ tr|M|` (trace-monotone).
   The contraction `‖K‖ ≤ 1` from `KKᴴ ⪯ 1` is `eigenvalue_le_l2opNorm` / L2Operator.
3a. ✅ **DONE** `re_trace_antiHermitian_mul_posSemidef` + `re_trace_mul_le_opNorm_mul_trace`
   (`OpNormHolder.lean`, commit `03059518`): general `Re tr(C·P) ≤ ‖C‖·tr P` (arbitrary C, PSD P),
   CFC-free via the Hermitian-part split + shipped Hermitian keystone.
3b. ✅ **DONE** `re_trace_mul_le_opNorm_mul_traceNorm` (commit `6db70cc6`): `Re tr(K·M) ≤ ‖K‖·‖M‖₁`
   for invertible M, via polar `M=U|M|` + 3a + unitary `‖U‖=1` (`CStarRing.norm_star_mul_self`).
   ⚠️ **CONFIRMED BLOCKER for `‖K‖≤1`:** the matrix `CStarAlgebra` instance whnf-times-out (200k
   heartbeats) — `CStarAlgebra.norm_le_one_iff_of_nonneg`, `norm_cfc_le`, and the whole isometric-CFC
   family are UNUSABLE on `Matrix ι ι ℂ` (verified in isolation via `lean_run_code`). The `spectrum`
   route (`spectrum.norm_le_norm_of_mem`, used by the shipped `eigenvalue_le_l2opNorm`) works but is
   the wrong direction.
4. **`‖K‖ ≤ 1` from `KKᴴ ⪯ 1` — build via the EuclideanLin CLM bridge (avoids CStarAlgebra):**
   `Matrix.l2_opNorm_def : ‖A‖ = ‖toEuclideanCLM A‖`; `ContinuousLinearMap.opNorm_le_iff` /
   `opNorm_le_bound` reduce `‖K‖≤1` to `∀v, ‖K v‖ ≤ ‖v‖`; and `‖Kᴴv‖² = ⟪KKᴴv, v⟫ ≤ ⟪v,v⟫ = ‖v‖²`
   from `KKᴴ ⪯ 1` (translate Loewner to the Euclidean inner-product form via `Matrix.PosSemidef` ⟹
   `0 ≤ ⟪(1−KKᴴ)v, v⟫`). Then `‖K‖=‖Kᴴ‖`. **Then forward bound** `re_trace_block_le_sqrtFidelity`:
   `Re tr X = Re tr(K√σ√ρ) ≤ ‖K‖·‖√σ√ρ‖₁ ≤ F` (brick 3b + `re_trace_le_traceNorm` SHIPPED + cyclic).
   Perturb singular `ρ,σ` via the shipped `+1/k•1` + `continuous_traceNorm`.
5. `sqrtFidelity_attained` : feasible `X* = √ρ·V·√σ` (polar `V` of `√σ√ρ`, project's invertible-case
   polar) with `Re tr X* = ‖√σ√ρ‖₁ = sqrtFidelity`.
6. Headline `sqrtFidelity_mixedUnitary_ge` = transport (brick 2) ∘ attainment (5) ∘ forward (4);
   joint-concavity corollary; general CPTP via a project-side Stinespring dilation (larger). NO axiom.
