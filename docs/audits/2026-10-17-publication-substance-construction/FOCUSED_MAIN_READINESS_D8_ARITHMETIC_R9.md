# Publication readiness after the D8 recurrence arithmetic repair

The canonical graph measured all 231 gates for 21 bundles at
`3bfc51622` on [draft PR #118](https://github.com/NetRxn/SK_EFT_Hawking/pull/118).
All gate states match R8: **159 passed, 22 blocked, 30 open and 20 requiring
recheck**. Zero bundles have all eleven gates passed. The comparison
holds Lean source and the retained catalog constant and inherits the
catalog freshness limitation.

D8's displayed successor multiplier and both descriptions of the
identity-target worked depth agree with the current Lean source.
Independent review and the two enforced canonical closure verifiers
passed. The tighter invariant at the original base precision remains a
separate BUILD. D8 G7 remains blocked, G1 and G4 remain open, and G10 and
G11 require recheck.
