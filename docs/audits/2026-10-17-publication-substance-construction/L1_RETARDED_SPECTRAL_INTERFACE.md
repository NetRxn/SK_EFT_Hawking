# L1 retarded tensor spectral interface

Assume a matched stationary equilibrium state and a reciprocal Hermitian tensor channel. Project the once-pair sources into transverse-traceless polarizations after fixing operator normalization, mixing, and off-diagonal weights. Use the response convention (R(t)=+i\theta(t)\langle[Q(t),Q(0)]\rangle) for a source Hamiltonian `H' = −jQ`. After subtracting matched local contact terms and treating any static-only zero mode separately, a positive semidefinite spectral measure on positive frequencies gives

```text
R(z,k) = ∫ 2ν/(ν² − z²) dΣ(ν,k),  Im z > 0
E(Ω,k) = R(iΩ,k)
```

This uses the reciprocal odd commutator spectrum. A nonreciprocal channel needs the signed-frequency matrix and the corresponding momentum reversal. The existing Euclidean normalization provides the source scaling under its hypotheses. It leaves the existence, positivity, and real-time matching of the physical state open.

## Exact positive countercontrol

At fixed momentum, use the static-weight measure `dμ = 2 dΣ/ν`, with frequencies in one common unit. Model A places unit weight at 1. Model B places half weights at 1/2 and 2. Both give `E(0)=1` and `E(1)=1/2` under the kernel `ν²/(ν²+Ω²)`. At Ω=2 they give 1/5 and 19/68 respectively. Their causal time responses are `θ(t) sin t` and `θ(t) [sin(t/2)/4 + sin(2t)]`. The two measures can multiply the same positive semidefinite polarization matrix and have identical local contacts.

For N distinct sampled squared frequencies, form the N-by-(N+1) matrix of sampled kernels at distinct positive atoms. A real null vector perturbs any strictly positive starting weights in both directions by a sufficiently small amount while preserving all samples. The two resulting measures have different retarded poles or residues. With N distinct baseline atoms the corresponding square matrix is an invertible diagonally scaled Cauchy matrix. A small positive spectral band can therefore be added and its sampled contribution canceled by changing the baseline atom weights, which stay positive for sufficiently small added mass. This gives admissible data sets where even the presence of continuous absorption is underdetermined.

## Physical acceptance boundary

The countercontrol applies to finite Euclidean samples in this spectral class. To identify the L1 retarded pole and transport coefficient, the original model still needs a physical matched state, control of contact terms and static modes, and time-dependent evidence. Candidate routes include a controlled real-time correlator, complete Euclidean time data under a justified continuation class, or enough dynamic measurements to test a prospectively justified finite-parametric model. For a flat added static-weight density ε on (0,δ) below the baseline poles, the positive-frequency absorptive response changes from zero to πεΩ/2 in that interval. This is a susceptibility slope. Extracting Γ_H requires isolating the pole and matching the inverse response.

## Independent review

The independent adversarial reviewer `/root/l1_transport_review` verified the causal sign and time kernel, exact atom example, scaled Cauchy invertibility, and positive band compensation. The result is existential for admissible positive spectra with matched contacts. Physical tensor realization and the L1 transport finding remain open.
