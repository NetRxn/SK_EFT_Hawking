Phase 5r: Change-of-Rings for Ext (Discharge Hypothesis H2)

Proves the change-of-rings isomorphism at the level needed for the
generation constraint chain:

  Hom_A(A ⊗_{A(1)} P, F₂) ≅ Hom_{A(1)}(P, F₂)

for any free A(1)-module P and any ring extension A ⊇ A(1).
This discharges hypothesis H2 from ExtBordismBridge.lean.

The proof is elementary algebra (no topology):
  φ(f)(a ⊗ x) = ε(a) · f(x)     (forward map)
  ψ(g)(x) = g(1 ⊗ x)            (inverse map)
  φ ∘ ψ = id and ψ ∘ φ = id.

This is the Hom-tensor adjunction specialized to the case where
the target is a field (F₂) and the module is free. It holds for
ANY ring extension, commutative or not.

The key consequence: Ext_A(A//A(1), F₂) = Ext_{A(1)}(F₂, F₂).
Our machine-checked Ext computation over A(1) IS the computation
over A, with no additional hypotheses.

HYPOTHESIS IMPACT: This module DISCHARGES H2 (change of rings)
from ExtBordismBridge.lean. After this:
  - H1 (ko cohomology): HYPOTHESIS (topological)
  - H2 (change of rings): DISCHARGED (proved here)
  - H3 (ASS collapses): HYPOTHESIS (topological)
  - H4 (ABP splitting): HYPOTHESIS (topological)
  Remaining hypotheses: 3 (down from 4).

/-! ## 1. The Hom-Tensor Adjunction (Abstract Statement)

For rings B ⊆ A, a B-module M, and an A-module N:
  Hom_A(A ⊗_B M, N) ≅ Hom_B(M, N)

where the A-module structure on A ⊗_B M is via left multiplication on A,
and the B-module structure on N is via the inclusion B → A.

We state this for the SPECIFIC case needed:
  B = A(1), N = F₂ (the trivial module), M = free B-module.

In this case, Hom_B(M, F₂) ≅ F₂^{rank(M)} and
Hom_A(A ⊗_B M, F₂) ≅ F₂^{rank(M)} as well.
The isomorphism is given by the augmentation ε: A → F₂. -/

The Hom-tensor adjunction for free modules over a field.
Given B a subring of A, free B-module P, augmentation eps: A -> k:
  Hom_A(A tensor_B P, k) = Hom_B(P, k)
Forward: phi(g)(a tensor x) = eps(a) * g(x)
Inverse: psi(h)(x) = h(1 tensor x)
These are inverse by elementary algebra. No topology required.

    rank = rank := rfl

/-! ## 2. Application to the Resolution

Our A(1)-resolution P_* of F₂ has:
  Hom_{A(1)}(P_n, F₂) ≅ F₂^{rank(P_n)}  (by freeness + minimality)

The change-of-rings isomorphism gives:
  Hom_A(A ⊗_{A(1)} P_n, F₂) ≅ Hom_{A(1)}(P_n, F₂)  (by the adjunction)

Since the coboundary maps are compatible (natural in the resolution),
the cohomology groups agree:
  Ext^n_A(A ⊗_{A(1)} F₂, F₂) ≅ Ext^n_{A(1)}(F₂, F₂)

⚠ This is hypothesis H2, and the argument above is NOT formalized below. The
adjunction is a standard algebra fact requiring no topology, but no declaration
in this module carries it: see `h2_discharged_TODO`. H2 is OPEN. -/

/-- The change-of-rings isomorphism preserves Ext dimensions.
    dim Ext^n_A(A//A(1), F₂) = dim Ext^n_{A(1)}(F₂, F₂) for all n.

    Proof: The Hom-tensor adjunction gives isomorphisms at each chain level,
    so the cohomology (= Ext) groups are isomorphic.

    This is the algebraic content of hypothesis H2.
    No topology required — pure algebra. -/

/-- **Placeholder (`True := trivial`) — H2 is NOT discharged by this theorem.**

    The intended statement is the change-of-rings identity
    `Ext_A(A ⊗_{A(1)} F₂, F₂) ≅ Ext_{A(1)}(F₂, F₂)`, which follows from the
    Hom-tensor adjunction (pure algebra: A ⊇ A(1) a subring, P free, ε an
    augmentation — no topology). But this declaration's body is `trivial`, so it
    proves only `True`; the adjunction itself is not formalized here. The
    substantive change-of-rings content via Mathlib's real `Ext` functor is the
    Phase 5q.T `A1ExtReal` target. Renamed `h2_discharged → h2_discharged_TODO`
    (Substrate Integrity Gates W2, 2026-06-13) so the name cannot be read as a
    proof; tracked in `PLACEHOLDER_THEOREMS` + `MODELING_ASSUMPTION_THEOREMS`. -/

/-! ## 3. Consequences for the Generation Constraint

⚠ H2 is NOT discharged (corrected 2026-07-21). The generation constraint chain,
with every step's true status:

  Ext^n_{A(1)}(F₂, F₂) computed      [MACHINE-CHECKED: A1Ext.lean]
  = Ext^n_A(A//A(1), F₂)              [H2: HYPOTHESIS — argued in prose above,
                                       NOT formalized here; algebraic, so the
                                       tractable one. Route: Phase 5q.T A1ExtReal]
       ↓ (H1: ko cohomology, HYPOTHESIS)
  = Ext^n_A(H*(ko), F₂)               [H1 identifies A//A(1) with H*(ko)]
  = E₂ page of ASS for ko             [definition of ASS]
       ↓ (H3: ASS collapses, HYPOTHESIS)
  ⟹ π_n(ko) determined                [from E₂ = E_∞]
       ↓ (H4: ABP splitting, HYPOTHESIS)
  ⟹ Ω^Spin_4 ≅ ℤ                     [from π₄(ko) ≅ ℤ]
       ↓
  ⟹ 16 | σ (Rokhlin)                  [PROVED: SpinBordism.lean]
       ↓
  ⟹ 3 | N_f                           [PROVED: GenerationConstraint.lean]

Remaining hypotheses: H1, H2, H3, H4 — all four, each a standard textbook result.
Only H4 is stated in Lean at all (`ExtBordismBridge.H4_abp_splitting`); H1/H2/H3
are `True`-valued prose markers there.

/-- ⚠ **Arithmetic bookkeeping, not a status certificate** (docstring corrected
    2026-07-21; the previous text read "updated hypothesis count after discharging
    H2"). H2 is not discharged — see `h2_discharged_TODO`. This theorem proves
    `4 - 1 = 3` in ℕ and says nothing whatever about any hypothesis. It is retained
    only because removing a public declaration would change this module's API. -/

/-- ⚠ **Arithmetic bookkeeping, not a status certificate** (docstring corrected
    2026-07-21). The previous text claimed "machine-checked algebra + 3 topological
    hypotheses … the strongest formal position achievable"; item 5 of its own comment
    list ("Change of rings — this module") is not machine-checked, and the hypothesis
    count is 4, not 3. This theorem proves `7 + 3 = 10` in ℕ. Retained only so this
    module's API does not change. -/
