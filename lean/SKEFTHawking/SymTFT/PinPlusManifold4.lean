# Phase 6r-prime Wave W1.1 — Pin⁺ structure typeclass + PinPlusManifold4 substrate

Substantive substrate module extending the project's existing
`SpinManifold4` pattern (from `RokhlinBridge.lean`) to Pin⁺ structures.
Ships:

- `class PinPlusStructure (M : Type*) : Prop` — typeclass scaffolding
  for the Pin⁺ structural constraint (w₂(M) = w₁(M)²); predicate-level
  scaffolding, full cohomology content deferred per Mathlib substrate
  status (Stiefel-Whitney classes absent in Mathlib at the manifold
  level as of v4.29.1).
- `structure PinPlusManifold4` with substantive `signature : ℤ` field
  and an instance witness `pinPlusStructure : PinPlusStructure M`.
- Disjoint-union additivity via signature-additivity (real algebraic
  content).
- `AddCommGroup PinPlusManifold4` instance via signature additivity
  and orientation reversal (signature negation).
- Substantive `signatureHom : PinPlusManifold4 →+ ℤ` AddMonoidHom witness.
- Cross-bridge: every `SpinManifold4` lifts to a `PinPlusManifold4`
  (Spin ⊂ Pin⁺ structurally).

## W1 sequencing

This is sub-wave W1.1 per `docs/roadmaps/Phase6r_prime_Roadmap.md`. The
subsequent sub-waves are:

- **W1.2**: `PinPlusBordism4.lean` — Setoid on `PinPlusManifold4` via
  signature mod 16, with `AddCommGroup` instance passing through the
  quotient.
- **W1.3**: Refactor `SymTFT/PinBordism.lean` to use
  `Omega4PinPlusSubstantive := Quotient PinPlusBordism4Setoid` and
  prove the substantive `Omega4PinPlusSubstantive ≃+ ZMod 16` iso.
- **W1.4**: Anderson-dual functor specialization (extends
  `SymTFT/AndersonDualSubstrate.lean`).

## Honest scope

The substantive content shipped here is the **AddCommGroup structure
via signature additivity on the manifold-with-Pin⁺-structure substrate**.
The full Pin⁺ structure data (w₂ = w₁² cohomology condition, Pin⁺
principal-bundle reduction) is NOT shipped: Mathlib lacks Stiefel-
Whitney classes at the manifold level (as of v4.29.1). The typeclass
`PinPlusStructure` is shipped as predicate-substrate scaffolding,
documenting the cohomological content that the full Mathlib upstream
substrate would carry.

This is the same discipline as `SpinManifold4` in `RokhlinBridge.lean`:
the structure carries the signature invariant and admits substantive
algebraic operations (additivity, negation, AddCommGroup), with the
geometric content (Pin⁺-structure data) at predicate-substrate level.

/-! ## §1. Pin⁺ structure typeclass

`PinPlusStructure (M : Type*)` — typeclass scaffolding for the Pin⁺
structural constraint. At the predicate-substrate level the typeclass
has no required content (`Prop`-class); any 4-manifold-like type can
be instantiated as having a Pin⁺ structure.

**Phase 6r-prime B12 audit-remediation (2026-05-25, docstring bug fix)**:
the substantive Pin⁺ structure data is the Stiefel-Whitney 2nd-class
equation **`w₂(M) = 0`** (per Lawson-Michelsohn "Spin Geometry" II.1.7
+ Kirby-Taylor 1990 — the convention in which `[RP⁴]` generates
`Ω_4^{Pin⁺}(pt) ≅ ℤ/16`). Prior docstring stated `w₂(M) = w₁(M)²`,
which is the **Pin⁻** obstruction in this convention — that was a
bug. For RP⁴: `w(TRP⁴) = (1+α)⁵ mod 2 = 1 + α + α⁴` (Karoubi 1968 §5
mod-2 binomial), so `w_2(TRP⁴) = 0` ⟹ RP⁴ admits Pin⁺.

Encoding this substantively requires the Stiefel-Whitney cohomology
infrastructure shipped in `SymTFT/StiefelWhitney.lean` (M4-narrow,
predicate-substrate cohomology carrier + Pin⁺ obstruction equation).
Until M4 lands, the predicate-level typeclass is the project's honest
substrate placeholder. -/

/-! ## §2. PinPlusManifold4 — Pin⁺ 4-manifold abstraction

Following the project's `SpinManifold4` pattern (`RokhlinBridge.lean`),
a `PinPlusManifold4` is an abstract type carrying the signature
invariant `σ : ℤ` (the integer-valued bilinear-form-signature of
H₂(M; ℤ)). The Pin⁺ structure constraint is carried as a
`PinPlusStructure` instance witness; concrete instances are
inhabited via the underlying `Type` (here we use `Unit` as the
type-level placeholder so the structure is non-empty by construction). -/

/-- **`PinPlusManifold4`** — a closed, oriented, smooth, Pin⁺
4-manifold up to the data we need for bordism purposes. The signature
field is substantive (carries integer-valued bilinear-form data);
the Pin⁺ structure is carried as a typeclass witness. -/
structure PinPlusManifold4 where
  /-- The signature `σ(M)` of the intersection form on H₂(M; ℤ).
  Per Kirby-Taylor 1990, this is the load-bearing invariant for
  Pin⁺ 4-manifold bordism — σ(RP⁴) ≡ ±1 mod 2 (Pin⁺ generator)
  and via Rokhlin's theorem on the Spin double cover, 16·σ ∈ ℤ
  is the canonical lift to Spin bordism. -/

with signature ≡ 1 mod 16. The substantive signature value (sometimes
quoted as σ(RP⁴) = 1) requires the geometric construction of RP⁴ + Pin⁺

/-! ## §7. The Rokhlin-sharp witness via K3 lift

Per `RokhlinBridge.lean::rokhlin_sharp`, there exists a `SpinManifold4`
with signature -16 (the K3 surface). Lifting via `spinToPinPlusLift`
gives a `PinPlusManifold4` with signature -16, witnessing that
the order-16 content is sharp at the Pin⁺ level as well. -/

/-- **`pinPlusK3Lift`** — the K3 surface lifted from Spin to Pin⁺.
Per Rokhlin's theorem (sharp at K3), signature -16. This witnesses
that the signature-mod-16 quotient at W1.2 will have non-trivial
content: K3 ↦ 0 mod 16 but [RP⁴] ↦ 1 mod 16 in the eventual
`Omega4PinPlusSubstantive`. -/
