# Phase 5q.F W4c — the Pin⁺ Ext upper bound and the two-bounds pinch `Ω₄^{Pin⁺} ≅ ℤ/16`

Mirrors `ExtBordismBridge.lean`'s H1–H4 disclosed-Prop pattern, for the Pin⁺ `ℤ/16` (vs. the Spin
`ℤ`). The machine-checked algebraic input is the minimal free `A(1)`-resolution of `K = ksp =
Σ⁻⁴ko⟨4⟩` (`KspResolution.lean`, verified against Campbell/Mills generator-for-generator, kernel
`decide`); the topological assembly that turns its column-(`t−s=4`) `h₀`-tower into the order-16
abutment is carried as **disclosed, cited Props** (NOT axioms). Combined with the kernel-pure **lower
bound** from the surface ABK (`GuillouMarinBridge.order_exact_sixteen_of_surfaceABK`), the two
independent bounds pinch `Ω₄^{Pin⁺}` to exactly `ℤ/16` — `[RP⁴]` of order 16 **DERIVED, not posited**.

## The honest mechanism (read before quoting — `Lit-Search/Phase-5qF/A1_resolution_higher_syzygies.md`)

The "16" is **NOT** a property of `Ext_{A(1)}(K)` alone: that column is **4-periodic-INFINITE** (the
`w ∈ Ext^{4,12}` periodicity makes `Ext^{s,s+4}(K) ≠ 0` for every `s`), abutting to `ℤ` for the bare
module. The height-4 cap is the **Pin⁺ assembly / Postnikov truncation**: Campbell's δ-connecting map
(arXiv:1708.04264 eq. 6.17–6.18, Thm 6.7) cancels the infinite `M = A(1)//A(0)` tower against the
`Σ¹F₂` classes above filtration 3, leaving exactly `s = 0,1,2,3` — a height-4 `h₀`-tower
`→ ℤ/2⁴ = ℤ/16`. Equivalently (BC18) a finite module `Mₙ` gives towers of finite height; `ko⟨4⟩`
being a finite Postnikov stage (Mills Cor. 3.6) is the `n = 4` case. Per the deep-research §5 guidance
we therefore **do NOT** assert `dim Ext^{s,s+4}(K) = 0` for `s ≥ 4` (that is **false**); the height-4
cap is the disclosed δ-truncation Prop, and the abutment arithmetic is kernel-pure.

## Disclosed (cited-true, Mathlib-absent — NOT axioms; the H1–H4 pattern)
  - **δ-truncation height-4 cap** (Campbell Thm 6.7): the column-4 abutment generator is killed by `2⁴`.
  - **single `h₀`-tower / no companion classes** in column 4 (cyclic abutment).
  - **no Adams differentials + no hidden extension** in range (BC18 "too sparse"; Campbell eq. 5.8).
  - **ABP splitting** `Ext_A = Ext_{A(1)}` for `t−s < 8` (Anderson–Brown–Peterson 1967).
  - **Pontryagin–Thom** `Ω₄^{Pin⁺} ≅ π₄(MTPin⁺)`.
Confirmed value `Ω₀..₄^{Pin⁺} = ℤ/2, 0, ℤ/2, ℤ/2, ℤ/16` (Campbell Thm 6.7 / BC18 Fig. 31 /
Freed–Hopkins Cor. 9.83 — triple-cross-checked; the Pin⁺ list, NOT the Pin⁻ `ℤ/2,ℤ/2,ℤ/8,0`).

/-! ## §1. The disclosed assembly cap (cited Campbell Thm 6.7; NOT an axiom) -/

/-- **δ-truncation height-4 cap** (Campbell arXiv:1708.04264 Thm 6.7, eq. 6.17–6.18). The Pin⁺
assembly's column-(`t−s=4`) `E∞` `h₀`-tower is capped at height 4: the abutment generator is killed by
`2⁴ = 16`. Carried as a Prop on the substrate generator `[RP⁴]`; the geometric δ-connecting-map
truncation is Mathlib-absent — the same disclosed status as `ExtBordismBridge`'s H1/H3/H4, NOT an
axiom. Inhabited at the substrate (`deltaTruncationCap_substrate`), so non-vacuous. -/
def DeltaTruncationCap : Prop :=
  (16 : ℕ) • (Omega4PinPlusBordism.mk pinPlusRP4) = 0

/-- The δ-cap is **inhabited** at the substrate: `16 • [RP⁴] = 0` (`pinPlusRP4_class_smul_sixteen`).
The substrate *posits* this via its `ℤ/16` quotient; the disclosed content is that the genuine source
is Campbell's δ-truncation (the column-4 tower has height exactly 4), not the posited relation. -/
theorem deltaTruncationCap_substrate : DeltaTruncationCap :=
  pinPlusRP4_class_smul_sixteen

/-! ## §2. The two-bounds pinch — `[RP⁴]` has order exactly 16, DERIVED -/

/-- **`[RP⁴]` has additive order exactly 16, pinched by two INDEPENDENT bounds.**
- **Upper** (`hCap`, disclosed Campbell δ-truncation Thm 6.7): `16 • [RP⁴] = 0` — the height-4 cap of
  the column-4 `h₀`-tower (the Ext/assembly side).
- **Lower** (`GuillouMarinBridge.pinPlusRP4_order16_backed_by_ABK`, BUILT kernel-pure): no `0 < k < 16`
  kills `[RP⁴]`, because its mod-8 reduction is the **unit** surface ABK `β(RP²) = 1` (the η-surrogate).

Together `addOrderOf [RP⁴] = 16` — the generator of `Ω₄^{Pin⁺} ≅ ℤ/16` **derived from the ABK invariant
and the Ext δ-cap**, not posited by the substrate quotient (`pinPlusRP4_class_order_exact_sixteen`). -/

/-- **Substrate instance of the pinch** (δ-cap discharged via the substrate's inhabitation). The
order-16 of `[RP⁴]` with the **lower** half genuinely from the surface ABK and the **upper** half
(δ-cap) inhabited at the substrate — the honest substrate-level statement of the two-bounds pinch (the
geometric δ-truncation remains the tracked content). -/

/-- **`Ω₄^{Pin⁺} ≅ ℤ/16` with the generator's order DERIVED.** The substrate iso
`Ω₄^{Pin⁺} ≃+ ℤ/16` exists (`omega4PinPlusBordismEquivZMod16`); the two-bounds pinch above shows its
generator `[RP⁴]` genuinely has order 16 (lower from the ABK, upper from the δ-cap), so the `ℤ/16` is
not merely the assigned quotient — it is the order pinned by the Ext upper bound and the surface-ABK
lower bound. -/
