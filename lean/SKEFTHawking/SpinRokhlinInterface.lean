Phase 5q.B Waves B3/B4: smooth-spin 4-manifold interface and the wired `16 ∣ σ`

INTERFACE-FIRST (roadmap Wave B3). A closed smooth spin 4-manifold contributes exactly the
data the spectra-free Rokhlin derivation needs:
  • its intersection form is **even unimodular** (Wu's formula + Poincaré duality — topological),
  • the extra factor of two `2 ∣ σ/8` (Â-genus even / Arf(q̄)=0 — the irreducible topological input,
    Atiyah–Singer index / Freedman–Kirby; this is what genuinely distinguishes smooth from
    topological, per Freedman's E₈ manifold).

The algebraic bound `8 ∣ σ` (van der Blij) is **no longer carried as interface data** — it is now a
kernel-pure THEOREM (`RokhlinHMRankFour.eight_dvd_latticeSig`), derived from even-unimodularity via the
classification `E₈^a ⊕ (−E₈)^b ⊕ H^c` (existence DISCHARGED: Hasse–Minkowski `[HM]` via the rank-4
quaternary route + theta-modularity `[Θ]` for the definite case).

The signature here is the genuine `latticeSig form` (`LatticeSignature.lean`), NOT a free integer
parameter: a manifold's signature *is* the signature of its intersection form. From these data,
`16 ∣ latticeSig form` is a kernel-pure THEOREM via `RokhlinHMRankFour.sixteen_dvd_latticeSig`
(= `rokhlin_from_serre_plus_topology` on `latticeSig`, with `8 ∣ σ` now proved) — NO global Rokhlin
hypothesis, NO new axiom.

It does NOT use Anderson–Brown–Peterson or Rokhlin's theorem itself as input (Rokhlin's theorem
*is* the conclusion `16 ∣ σ`); the `2 ∣ σ/8` field is the more primitive index-theoretic fact.

STATUS (2026-06-08): `8 ∣ σ` is DISCHARGED and the `eight_dvd` field has been DROPPED. The classification
EXISTENCE statement (every even unimodular form ≅ `E₈^a ⊕ (−E₈)^b ⊕ H^c`) is proved — both irreducible
pieces landed: Hasse–Minkowski (`RokhlinHMRankFour.hasWeakIsotropicVector`, all ranks; rank-4 frontier via
binary Hilbert reciprocity) and theta-modularity (definite `8 ∣ rank`). The **only remaining tracked
hypothesis is `topo`** (`2 ∣ σ/8`), which is irreducibly topological (not an axiom, not algebraic).

/-- A closed smooth spin 4-manifold, carrying exactly the data the Rokhlin derivation consumes:
    its even-unimodular intersection form and the topological factor-of-two. Its signature is
    `latticeSig form` (see `SmoothSpinManifold4.sig`), not a free parameter.

    The algebraic bound `8 ∣ σ` is **no longer an interface field** — it is now a kernel-pure theorem
    (`eight_dvd_latticeSig`, via the discharged Hasse–Minkowski `hasIsotropicVector` + theta-modularity),
    so a smooth spin 4-manifold is determined by its (even-unimodular) form and the genuinely topological
    factor `2 ∣ σ/8` alone. -/

    `RokhlinBridge.sixteen_convergence_full`: the `16 ∣ σ` conjunct is now a *theorem*
    (`SmoothSpinManifold4.rokhlin`), not an assumed input. -/
