# Channel structure for the diamond norm (Phase 6AE-B)

The concrete finite-dimensional infrastructure underlying the diamond norm:
the **partial trace** and the **Choi matrix**, built explicitly on
`Matrix (Fin m × Fin n) (Fin m × Fin n) ℂ` (no Stinespring, no abstract C*).

* `partialTrace M` traces out the second tensor factor: `(∑ k, M (i,k) (j,k))`.
* `choiMatrix Φ` is the Choi/Jamiołkowski matrix of a linear map `Φ` on matrices.

These are independent of the trace-norm *metric* theory (they do not use the
triangle inequality), so they are proven here; the diamond norm's analytic
properties are documented as the deferred frontier below.

Invariants: kernel-pure, zero sorry, zero project-local axioms, no `maxHeartbeats`.

## STATUS (updated 2026-06-01 after Phase 6AF)

Most of the analytic frontier that 6AE deferred has since been PROVEN in Phase 6AF — the
6AE blocker note ("no von Neumann / Ky Fan / polar / Schatten") was bypassed by a
positive-part + Hermitian-dilation + charpoly route that needs none of them:

* **Step 3 — trace-norm triangle**: ✅ DONE (`MixedState.traceNorm_hermitian_triangle`,
  and the *general* non-Hermitian `traceNorm_triangle` via the Hermitian dilation).
* **Step 2 — `traceDist ∈ [0,1]` + metric triangle**: ✅ DONE (`traceDist_triangle`,
  `traceDist_mem_Icc`).
* **Step 4 — Uhlmann fidelity**: ✅ FOUNDATION DONE (`sqrtFidelity`/`fidelity`, `=1` on the
  diagonal, symmetric, Uhlmann form verified). `F ≤ 1` (`sqrtFidelity_le_one`) and the
  Fuchs–van de Graaf **lower** bound `1−F ≤ D` (`one_sub_sqrtFidelity_le_traceDist`) are now PROVEN
  (Phase 6AF-7, `FidelityBounds.lean`); only the FvdG **upper** bound `D ≤ √(1−F²)` remains fenced
  (Uhlmann purification, grep-verified absent).
* **Step 5 — CPTP contractivity** `D(Φρ,Φσ) ≤ D(ρ,σ)`: ✅ DONE (`CPTPChannel.lean`,
  `traceDist_krausMap_le`).
* **Step 6 — `diamondNorm`** `‖Φ‖_◇ = sup_ρ ‖(Φ⊗id)ρ‖₁`: the **Choi positivity**
  half of the channel–state duality is proven below (`choiMatrix_krausMap_posSemidef`).
  The full diamond *norm* (the supremum over states + its boundedness/attainment, the
  tensor channel `Φ⊗id` over the product index, and the norm axioms) remains the
  DEFERRED FRONTIER — see the dedicated note after the Choi theorem below.

/-- **Choi positivity (channel–state duality, 6AF-5)**: the Choi matrix of a Kraus channel
`Φ(ρ) = ∑ₖ Kₖ ρ Kₖᴴ` is positive semidefinite. This is the "easy" (⟹) direction of Choi's
theorem — complete positivity implies a PSD Choi matrix — proven concretely: the Choi matrix
is `∑ₖ wₖ wₖᴴ` with `wₖ(p) = Kₖ(p.2, p.1)`, a sum of rank-one PSD outer products. -/

## STATUS — the diamond norm (updated 2026-06-01, Phase 6AF-6)

`choiMatrix_krausMap_posSemidef` above gives the channel–state-duality positivity. The diamond
norm itself has since been BUILT in `DiamondNormSup.lean`, in its operational trace-distance form
`diamondDist Φ₁ Φ₂ = sup_ρ D((Φ₁⊗id)ρ, (Φ₂⊗id)ρ) = ½‖Φ₁−Φ₂‖_◇`:

* the two earlier blockers dissolved — the **tensor channel `Φ⊗id`** is now a CPTP Kraus channel
  (`isKrausChannel_tensorKraus`, via the Kronecker mixed-product lemmas), and the **product-index**
  obstruction vanished once the trace-norm / CPTP theory was generalized from `Fin n` to an
  arbitrary `[Fintype ι][DecidableEq ι]` (Phase 6AF-6a), instantiated here at `Fin n × Fin n`;
* the **supremum** is well-defined via `Real.sSup` from **boundedness alone** (every term is in
  `[0,1]` since the stabilized outputs are density operators) — attainment is *not* needed to
  define it or to prove its properties: `diamondDist` is proven nonnegative, `≤ 1`, symmetric,
  and zero on the diagonal.

Since then (Phase 6AF-7/8, 2026-06-02) the **triangle inequality** (`diamondDist_triangle`, in
`DiamondNormSup.lean`) and **attainment** of the sup (`exists_diamondDist_eq`, in
`DiamondNormAttainment.lean`, via trace-norm continuity + compactness of the density set + EVT)
are both PROVEN — so `diamondDist` is a genuine `[0,1]`-valued metric whose supremum is a maximum.
The only remaining documented-deferred item (no sorry, no axiom) is the **Choi-SDP / Watrous
duality** characterization of the diamond norm: the full primal=dual SDP identity needs a
convex-duality substrate (`ProperCone`/`PointedCone`, conic strong duality) absent at pin. A
**primal (one-sided) lower bound** `diamondDist Φ₁ Φ₂ ≥ (1/2n)·‖J(Φ₁)−J(Φ₂)‖₁` is reachable
WITHOUT SDP duality — it is `le_diamondDist` evaluated at the maximally-entangled feasible point,
using `(Φ⊗id)(Ω/n) = (1/n)·choiMatrix(Φ)` — and is the next increment.
