# Fidelity under reversible (unitary) channels (Phase 6AJ — fidelity-domain data processing)

The trace-distance data-processing inequality (`traceDist_krausMap_le`, CPTP contractivity) is the
"distinguishability decreases" half of the metric structure on quantum states. Its fidelity-domain
partner is Uhlmann's monotonicity `F((Φ⊗id)ρ, (Φ⊗id)σ) ≥ F(ρ, σ)` (fidelity *increases* under a
CPTP map). This module ships the **reversible (unitary) case as an equality** — fidelity is exactly
invariant under conjugation by a unitary, `F(UρUᴴ, UσUᴴ) = F(ρ, σ)` — the data-processing statement
for unitary channels (and a building block for any reversible network).

Everything routes through the PSD-square-root-uniqueness workhorse `posSemidef_eq_of_mul_self_eq`
(NO continuous-functional-calculus conjugation lemma is needed): `√(U M Uᴴ) = U (√M) Uᴴ` and
`|U A Uᴴ| = U |A| Uᴴ` both follow because both sides are PSD with equal squares, and the trace norm
is then unitarily invariant by trace cyclicity.

**Fence (verified, Wave 6AJ.0 scout, interactive lean4 on Mathlib v4.29.1).** The *general* CPTP
Uhlmann monotonicity is NOT shipped. Mathlib provides operator-monotone `CFC.monotone_sqrt`, but it
does NOT provide joint concavity of fidelity, operator convexity of `t⁻¹` (Choi's inequality), Lieb
concavity, or purification / Stinespring dilation — the standard ingredients of the general proof.
The mixed-unitary subclass (`Φ(ρ) = ∑ pᵢ Uᵢ ρ Uᵢᴴ`) is reachable from the unitary case *plus* joint
concavity, so it too is blocked at this pin. Per the project's no-axiom policy the general case is
FENCED, not axiomatized; the reversible-channel equality below is the shipped deliverable.

Invariants: kernel-pure `{propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}`; no project-local axioms;
no `maxHeartbeats`; no `native_decide`.
