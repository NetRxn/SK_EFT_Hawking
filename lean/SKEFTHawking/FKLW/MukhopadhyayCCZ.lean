# Phase 6x Item L — Mukhopadhyay exact Clifford+CCZ synthesis (public math layer), increment 1

Mukhopadhyay 2024 (arXiv:2401.08950, "Synthesizing Toffoli-optimal quantum circuits for arbitrary
multi-qubit unitaries") gives a Toffoli/CS-count-optimal EXACT synthesis for the Clifford+Toffoli
gate set, which is Clifford-equivalent to Clifford+CCZ (Toffoli = `(I⊗I⊗H)·CCZ·(I⊗I⊗H)`). Its
exact-synthesis backbone (Thm 3.2) decomposes any exactly-implementable `U` as
`U = e^{iφ}·(∏_j G_{Pⱼ,Qⱼ,Rⱼ})·C₀` with `C₀` Clifford and each `G_{P,Q,R}` a *generating element*

  `G_{P,Q,R} = (3/4)·I + (1/4)·(P + Q + R − PQ − QR − RP + PQR)`        (Mukhopadhyay Eq. 12)

over a triple of pairwise-commuting non-identity Paulis with `R ≠ PQ` (Eq. 13).

This file ships (increments 1–4):

  - **Generating-element grounding** (`mukGen_Z_eq_CCZ`): the canonical diagonal generator at the
    three single-qubit `Z` Paulis equals the project's shipped `CCZ_mat`, `mukGen_Z = CCZ` (i.e.
    `G_{Z₁,Z₂,Z₃} = CCZ`) — `G` is `+1` on every computational-basis state except all-ones, where it
    is `−1`, exactly the CCZ diagonal (both sides diagonal; kernel-routine). This anchors the
    Mukhopadhyay exact-synthesis generating set in the project's CCZ gate.
  - **Gate alphabet + `interp` + exact-synthesis soundness**: the `CliffordCCZGate` ADT (the nine
    literal Clifford generators from the shipped SU(8) `cliffordCCZLiteralGenMap` + the CCZ
    generating element), `interp : List CliffordCCZGate → Matrix (Fin 8) (Fin 8) ℂ`, its composition
    soundness `interp_append`, and the **`synth_CCZ_correct` MVP at the canonical generator**:
    `mukGen_Z` is exactly Clifford+CCZ-representable, witnessed by the single-`CCZ` word
    (`interp [CCZ] = mukGen_Z`), plus the order-2 relation `interp [CCZ, CCZ] = I`.
  - **The general generating element + reflection structure** (`mukGen`, `mukGen_sq`): for ANY three
    pairwise-commuting involutions `p, q, r`, `G_{P,Q,R} = (3/4)I+(1/4)(p+q+r−pq−qr−rp+pqr)` is a
    reflection (`G² = I`) — the structural defining property of Mukhopadhyay's generating set (Eq. 12
    / Eq. 13). Instantiated at the `Z`-Paulis (`mukGen_Z_sq`: `CCZ² = I` via the generating-element
    structure).
  - **`synth_CCZ_correct` (the exact-synthesis MVP)**: `IsExactlyCliffordCCZ U := ∃ gs, interp gs = U`
    (expressible as a Clifford+CCZ gate word) is shown to be a submonoid containing every gate
    (`isExactlyCliffordCCZ_one`/`_mul`/`_gate`/`_ccz`); `synth` extracts a witnessing word and
    `synth_CCZ_correct : interp (synth U h) = U` is the kernel-routine exact-synthesis correctness
    for ANY exactly-representable `U`.

Continuations (documented, not shipped — the explicitly-optional "stretch" + the deeper
characterization): the MINIMAL / Toffoli-optimal synthesis (Mukhopadhyay Thm 3.2 + the
meet-in-the-middle search — CCZ-count-minimality), the channel-representation exact-implementability
CHARACTERIZATION of which `U` are representable (Fact 3.9), and the general `G_{P,Q,R}` realized
explicitly as a Clifford conjugate of CCZ (a concrete gate word, vs. the choice-extracted witness).

`zₐ = zsign a j`) evaluates to `+1` on every computational-basis state except all-ones (`j = 7`),
where it is `−1` — exactly the `CCZ` diagonal. This anchors the Mukhopadhyay exact-synthesis
generating set in the project's `CCZ_mat`. Both sides are diagonal, so the identity reduces to the
eight per-index `ℂ` evaluations (off-diagonal entries vanish on both sides). -/

/-! ## The general generating element is a reflection: `G_{P,Q,R}² = I` (increment 3)

For pairwise-commuting involutions `p, q, r` the Mukhopadhyay generator `G_{P,Q,R}` is a reflection
(`G² = I`) — the structural defining property of the generating set (its eigenvalues are `±1`, with
`−1` precisely on the joint `(−1,−1,−1)`-eigenspace). Slick proof: with `Y := (1−p)(1−q)(1−r)`,
each `(1−x)² = 2(1−x)` and they commute, so `Y² = 8Y`; and `G = 1 − (1/4)·Y`, whence `G² = 1`. -/

/-- **The general generating element is a reflection.** For pairwise-commuting involutions `p, q, r`
(`p² = q² = r² = 1`, `pq = qp`, `qr = rq`, `pr = rp`), the Mukhopadhyay generator squares to the
identity: `G_{P,Q,R}² = I`. -/

/-! ## `synth_CCZ_correct` — the exact-synthesis MVP (increment 4)

The MVP (Mukhopadhyay §"exact + correct", the kernel-routine matrix-equality target): for an
exactly-Clifford+CCZ-representable `U`, `synth` produces a Clifford+CCZ gate word that interprets
EXACTLY to `U` (`synth_CCZ_correct : interp (synth U h) = U`). `synth` extracts a witnessing word
from the representability proof — the project's standard constructive-from-existence pattern (cf.
`RossSelingerLightweight.cliffordTBaseFinder_constructive`). The exactly-representable set is shown to
be a submonoid containing every gate (so the MVP is non-vacuous over a substantive class).

What this MVP does NOT claim (documented continuations): the CHARACTERIZATION of which `U` are exactly
representable (Mukhopadhyay's channel-representation test, Fact 3.9) and the MINIMAL / Toffoli-optimal
synthesis (the meet-in-the-middle search, Thm 3.2 — the explicitly-optional "stretch"
