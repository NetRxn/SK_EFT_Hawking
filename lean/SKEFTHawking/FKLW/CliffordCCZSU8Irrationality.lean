# Phase 6z Wave 1 — the algebraic-integer / root-of-unity obstruction

The faithful literal Clifford+CCZ headline (`⟨H,S,CNOT,CCZ⟩` dense in SU(8), CCZ essential, no `T`)
needs a continuous one-parameter subgroup in the closure of the discrete group. Since every literal
generator is finite-order, the first such flow is seeded by an **infinite-order** element with an
**irrational eigen-angle**. The operative seed (Phase-6z Gate 1, `verify_seed.py`) is
`g₀ = (H⊗H⊗H · CCX)² ∈ SO(8)`, whose non-trivial eigenvalues are `λ_± = (−3 ± i√7)/4` with minimal
polynomial `2x² + 3x + 2` over `ℤ` (monic minpoly over `ℚ` is `x² + (3/2)x + 1`).

The mechanism: a finite-order unitary has all eigenvalues roots of unity, and a root of unity is an
**algebraic integer**. `λ_±` is **not** an algebraic integer (its monic `ℚ`-minimal polynomial has a
non-integer coefficient `3/2`; equivalently `λ + λ̄ = −3/2 ∉ ℤ`). Hence `λ_±` is not a root of unity,
so its argument is an irrational multiple of `π` — the seed for Kronecker accumulation.

This module ships the **general, reusable obstruction** (the highest-leverage Wave-1 artifact):

  `not_rootOfUnity_of_not_isIntegral : ¬ IsIntegral ℤ α → ∀ n, 0 < n → α ^ n ≠ 1`

via the monic integer polynomial `Xⁿ − 1` (a root of unity is integral). Independently reusable.

integer. This is the algebraic core of DR2's "phase preservation": the seed's genuine group element
`g_grp = ω⁻¹ · g₀` differs from `g₀` by a central root-of-unity phase, and that phase cannot turn the
non-algebraic-integer eigenvalue into an algebraic integer. -/
