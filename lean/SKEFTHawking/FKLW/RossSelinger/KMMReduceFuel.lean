# Phase 6x Tier-2 Item F (M4) — the `kmmReduce` fuel recursion + correctness

Assembles the runtime KMM synthesis recursion from the computable step
(`reduceStep`/`chooseReductionComp`, `KMMCompute.lean`) and the S/Z-compressed
reconstruction word (`reconWordC`):

  `kmmReduceFuel base n M` = peel `H·Tᵏ` (via the `chooseReductionComp` selector)
  up to `n` times, prepending each reconstruction syllable `reconWordC k`, then
  emit the base-finder word `base M` once no reducing `k` is found or the fuel
  runs out.

**Correctness (`interp_kmmReduceFuel`) is fully Lemma-3-INDEPENDENT**: it needs
only that each reconstruction step left-inverts the peel
(`interp_reconWordC_reduceStep`, purely algebraic) and that the base finder is
correct on realizable inputs. It does NOT need the sde to actually decrease — so
this is the `correct` field of `KMMReduction`, discharged *now*, parameterized on
a base finder.

What remains for the full discharge (DR-gated, see roadmap §3b): KMM **Lemma 3**
(the `chooseReductionComp` search succeeds when `sdeC ≥ 4`) gives termination /
fuel-sufficiency and the **length bound** `≤ N₃ + 4·sdeC` (each syllable is
`≤ 4` gates by `reconWordC_length_le_four`); plus the base finder itself
(`cliffordLookup`/𝕊₃ + the `N₃` numeral). Together those + this correctness
theorem construct a concrete `KMMReduction` and discharge `Nonempty KMMReduction`.
