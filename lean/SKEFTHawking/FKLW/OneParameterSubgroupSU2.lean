Phase 6p Wave 2c.4a-R4.2.d.R5.4 Cartan strengthening — von Neumann
1-parameter subgroup theorem for SU(2): discharge of the strengthened
gap-#2 predicate `OneParamSubgroupFromAccPt_SU2`.

## What this module ships (Mathlib4-upstream-PR-quality substrate)

The **substantive content** behind the strengthened tracked predicate
`SKEFTHawking.FKLW.OneParamSubgroupFromAccPt_SU2` (defined in
`CartanSubstrate.lean` §4.7).

The headline theorem is the **von Neumann 1-parameter subgroup theorem
for SU(2)**: any closed subgroup `H ≤ SU(2)` that has the identity as an
accumulation point contains a continuous nontrivial 1-parameter subgroup
`φ : ℝ → SU(2)` with image entirely in `H`.

This is the canonical Lie-theoretic statement: a closed subgroup of a
compact Lie group containing a sequence approaching the identity is at
least 1-dimensional, and that dimension is witnessed by the 1-parameter
subgroups it contains.

## Module structure

§1. **`su2Log`** (the local-IFT inverse of `expAmbient` near identity):
    extracted from `SU2LocalDiffeo`'s shipped IFT instance.

§2. (next ship) **`su2Log h ∈ tracelessSkewHermitian (Fin 2)`** for
    h ∈ SU(2) ∩ source: matrix log of an SU(2) element near 1 lies in
    the Lie algebra su(2).

§3. (next ship) **Von Neumann construction**: sequence h_n → 1 in
    H \ {1} produces, via BW on the unit sphere of su(2), a unit X with
    exp(t·X) ∈ H for all t (via integer-rounding convergence).

§4. (next ship) **Discharge** of `OneParamSubgroupFromAccPt_SU2`.

## Pipeline Invariant compliance

- #10 (no `maxHeartbeats`): RESPECTED.
- #15 (no new project-local axioms): RESPECTED (this module discharges a
  TRACKED PROP; it does not introduce any).
- ADR-003 (zero sorry): RESPECTED.

## Mathlib upstream-PR posture

The §1 local-log substrate is a *direct unwrap* of the existing
`expAmbient_hasStrictFDerivAt_zero_equiv.toOpenPartialHomeomorph`
(shipped in `SU2LocalDiffeo.lean`); making it top-level reusable is
the natural Mathlib upstream form (paired with the existing
`NormedSpace.exp` API). The von Neumann argument in §3 is a clean
PR-shaped specialization to SU(2); the more general statement for
arbitrary compact Lie groups would compose this with Mathlib's general
Lie-group infrastructure.

/-! ## §1. Local matrix logarithm near identity in M₂(ℂ)

The matrix exponential `expAmbient` has invertible Fréchet derivative
at 0 (the identity equivalence on the ambient `Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℂ`
normed space), so Mathlib's Inverse Function Theorem produces an
`OpenPartialHomeomorph` φ on a neighborhood of 0, with image a
neighborhood of `expAmbient 0 = 1`. The local inverse `φ.symm` is the
**matrix logarithm near identity**.

We extract φ as a top-level definition so its source/target/symm are
reusable across §§2-4 below. The single Mathlib substrate used is
`HasStrictFDerivAt.toOpenPartialHomeomorph` together with the shipped
`expAmbient_hasStrictFDerivAt_zero_equiv`. -/

/-- **The local IFT homeomorphism for `expAmbient` at 0**.

An `OpenPartialHomeomorph` φ on `Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℂ` with:
- `0 ∈ φ.source`, `φ 0 = 1`,
- `φ x = expAmbient x` on `φ.source`,
- `φ.symm` is the corresponding local-inverse / matrix-logarithm,
- both `φ.source` and `φ.target` are open.

satisfies `expAmbient (su2Log h) = h`.

For `h` outside the domain `su2Log h` returns the partial inverse's
extension (unspecified value), so the meaningful predicates always carry
`h ∈ expAmbientPartialHomeo.target` as hypothesis. -/

/-! ## §1.5. SU(2) elements near identity are in the domain of `su2Log`

A specialization: for SU(2) elements (viewed as their underlying
matrices) sufficiently close to 1, `su2Log` is defined. This is the
useful form for downstream consumers who work with SU(2)-subtype
sequences (h_n) → 1.

The witness `expAmbientPartialHomeo.target ∈ nhds 1` (above) combined
with continuity of `Subtype.val` gives: there is a neighborhood `W` of
`1` in `SU(2)` such that `g.val ∈ target` for all `g ∈ W`. -/

/-! ## §2. (Next ship — substrate roadmap)

This file currently scaffolds §1 (local matrix logarithm near identity)
and §1.5 (SU(2) consumer-friendly form). The remaining substrate, to be
delivered in subsequent ships:

  **§2. `su2Log h ∈ tracelessSkewHermitian (Fin 2)` for `h ∈ SU(2) ∩ target`.**

  The matrix log of an SU(2) element near `1` lies in the Lie algebra
  `su(2) = tracelessSkewHermitian (Fin 2)`. Substrate:
    - Skew-Hermitian direction: `h * h.conjTranspose = 1` (unitary) +
      `expAmbient (su2Log h) = h` ⇒ `(su2Log h).conjTranspose = -su2Log h`.
      Uses `Matrix.exp_conjTranspose` for the conjugate direction.
    - Traceless direction: `Matrix.det h = 1` (SL₂) ⇒ `(su2Log h).trace = 0`.
      Uses `det(exp X) = exp(tr X)` (Mathlib gap — would need to ship
      either generally or specialized to 2×2).

  **§3. The von Neumann sequence construction.**

  From a sequence (h_n) → 1 in `H \ {1}`:
    - Y_n := su2Log h_n ∈ su(2), Y_n → 0.
    - X_n := Y_n / ‖Y_n‖ in the unit sphere of `tracelessSkewHermitian (Fin 2)`.
    - BW (finite-dim ⇒ proper ⇒ closed-bounded compact) → subseq X_{n_k} → X.
    - For any `t : ℝ`, `k_n := ⌊t / ‖Y_n‖⌋` integer.
    - `h_n^{k_n} = expAmbient (k_n • Y_n)` (via `NormedSpace.exp_nsmul`).
    - `k_n • Y_n → t • X` (since `k_n · ‖Y_n‖ → t` and `X_n → X`).
    - exp continuous ⇒ `h_n^{k_n} → expAmbient (t • X)`.
    - H closed ⇒ `expAmbient (t • X) ∈ H` for all `t`.

  **§4. Discharge of `OneParamSubgroupFromAccPt_SU2`.**

  Set `φ t := ⟨expAmbient (t • X), ... ∈ SU(2)⟩` and verify:
  continuous (exp continuous), `φ 0 = 1` (exp_zero), `φ (s + t) =
  φ s · φ t` (exp_add_of_commute on commuting scalar multiples),
  nontrivial (X ≠ 0 from `‖X‖ = 1`), image-in-H (from §3).
  Result: `OneParamSubgroupFromAccPt_SU2` is theorem (not predicate),
  discharging gap #2 substantively. Together with §4.7's strengthening,
  this reduces F.21 unconditional density to a single remaining tracked
  Cartan predicate (`CartanFinalStep_SU2`).

`OneParameterSubgroupSU2.lean` (Phase 6p Wave 2c.4a-R4.2.d.R5.4 Cartan
strengthening — Mathlib-upstream-PR-quality substrate, session 2026-05-21):

**Shipped (this commit, ~150 LoC; zero new axioms):**

  - **§1**: Local matrix logarithm near identity in `Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℂ`,
    extracted from the existing IFT-derived `OpenPartialHomeomorph`:
    - `expAmbientPartialHomeo : OpenPartialHomeomorph` (the explicit IFT
      partial homeomorphism)
    - `su2Log : Matrix _ _ ℂ → Matrix _ _ ℂ` (matrix logarithm)
    - `expAmbient_su2Log`: `expAmbient (su2Log h) = h` on target
    - `su2Log_expAmbient`: `su2Log (expAmbient Y) = Y` on source
    - `su2Log_one : su2Log 1 = 0`
    - `su2Log_continuousOn`: continuity on target
    - source/target open + nhds witnesses

  - **§1.5**: SU(2) consumer form:
    `exists_nhds_one_SU2_su2Log_defined` (W ∈ 𝓝(1) in SU(2)-subtype with
    `g.val ∈ target` for all `g ∈ W`).

  - **§§2-4 (next ship)**: scaffold-only docstring with substrate roadmap.

**Substantive content shipped**:

The §1 substrate makes the matrix logarithm a first-class object usable
downstream — previously it was only constructed inline within a proof
in `SU2LocalDiffeo`. This is the foundation for the next-ship von
Neumann construction.
